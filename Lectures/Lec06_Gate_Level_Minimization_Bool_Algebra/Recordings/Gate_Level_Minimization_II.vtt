b506cc51-81bb-4890-b80c-a34732dbfdfa
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.760

dc53f9d0-6319-48bb-b7af-eb549fc8d7b9
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.428

00:05:38.996 --> 00:05:44.474
10 minutes. Uh, because no

c0cce301-74a9-4457-a37b-a8a9847064b7
00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:48.821

00:06:04.288 --> 00:06:09.190

So now let's back
to doing this here.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.608
 Let's go back too.

0c552ef1-44d3-4d7a-be8b-c7adf625e99b
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:42.668
Oh the survey. So as you can see
here 37 student participated in

NOTE Confidence: 0.8565459

07c5ac55-bb84-4017-9079-3dbbe53349f2
00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:49.116
this class. We have 100 about
120 student in the class, so I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8565459

ab265cae-3950-4b88-9b6d-b4e42094ae21
00:09:49.116 --> 00:09:55.068
wish I mean I leave it open. I
hope other student can

NOTE Confidence: 0.8565459

1e1a5f71-547f-45ed-9a41-0f47d45bbb48
00:09:55.068 --> 00:10:00.028
participate as well, but here is
the summary so far.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8062986

436f59c5-62dd-4293-b819-6e0816f1d870
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.986
I can see that I mean most of
these students are, I mean,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8062986

17ea3cb5-a39b-4a94-9fd2-1c0f0a05a223
00:10:05.986 --> 00:10:09.806
awesome or so so very few
students just wanted student

NOTE Confidence: 0.80252606

b38cd5b5-c4a5-4cab-a174-b259a5b8b1e5
00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:15.516
bad. And we'll see that this one is student. Actually put a lot 

NOTE Confidence: 0.80252606

8aa55c5f-6263-4bd3-81fe-5902c48b326f
00:10:15.516 --> 00:10:17.874
of I mean comments against the

97feeb1b-8a88-40c5-a3ee-c79f7fc0a7f3
00:10:17.874 --> 00:10:20.050
course. But seems.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737509

caf57b09-052d-4d79-a07d-f1b71e9fb810
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:26.400
I hope these people who put this
so so actually try. I mean to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8737509

970a3066-2126-4dda-b641-b428c4d285f8
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.840
come to this part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8736404

6924a3a0-9c8a-4232-b886-3f29e525661b
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.775
Uh, what I can say is that I
mean after the reading week

NOTE Confidence: 0.8736404

0439b0b0-8441-455a-a657-a1833d59e4fe
00:10:33.775 --> 00:10:37.150
we're going to. I mean,
explain some more complicated

NOTE Confidence: 0.8736404

a4fa50cb-3b51-4076-8554-b13fbfc87f65
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.900
things, but interesting, but
I mean complex things. So I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8736404

85ca5784-b1c6-45bb-8b98-59bfe7ed2b59
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:44.275
hope we can catch up with the
course material.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976284

7aac6ef2-873c-4d58-b5a2-0741bc685139
00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:52.030
Ah, Luckily most of you thinks
that this course is worth taking

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976284

fd7f7262-a937-4dc8-87e4-3039cad025a3
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:58.010
and based on these statistics
and most of you are OK with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7976284

3cae7ea5-4664-40a7-9e22-a537ab1a203f
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.610
course work, some of you seems
that it's too much.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8353374

1b65434f-5d7a-4fe9-a368-6207c224e6d9
00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:09.604
But what I can say is that even
still you think that there are

NOTE Confidence: 0.8353374

af668a2a-5e14-43b1-b9d9-c18108cb8445
00:11:09.604 --> 00:11:11.088
too much work coursework.

NOTE Confidence: 0.81935

445d4f3e-fbfa-4da4-83c3-6dbe7f5e2cb2
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:19.009
Believe me, I mean from my side
from my experience maybe I mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.81935

d091e39c-879d-415b-a7ba-5c22988534ea
00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:24.322
four or five years later you'll
see that the coursework and

NOTE Confidence: 0.81935

794e9a8a-1b5e-4b69-ae99-c30f8f355e34
00:11:24.322 --> 00:11:26.737
worth it for this course.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87320983

23fb5b6d-cc84-4eef-8903-4cc526bc621e
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.266
About the next assignment, most
of you are OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.794564

9d92bca4-752e-4646-9a17-a4dd8b12e6f8
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:38.390
And about the lab programming
assignments, most of your OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.794564

65b04bfb-19fa-49bc-bf39-5dd362a6fed1
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.960
Some of use too much.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89228135

4e7a003e-f1e7-4be2-a067-44f4d93df3f9
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.556
And so if you say difficult.

NOTE Confidence: 0.850064

b95e45dc-8396-4a75-afe7-bd9946bfda1b
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.978
For those that I mean, as I
said, they think that it is

NOTE Confidence: 0.850064

b65f25b2-da4c-4bc5-af55-41ac2dbec362
00:11:49.978 --> 00:11:53.538
difficult. I really suggest
you to attend the lab sections

NOTE Confidence: 0.850064

293b2da9-0a88-4412-b221-afb254aad326
00:11:53.538 --> 00:11:57.810
 because in the lab section the lab instructor can help you about 

NOTE Confidence: 0.850064

e41c4c54-7e12-4134-951c-86c5318bd0b7
00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.726
the programming issues even in
the office hour you can come

NOTE Confidence: 0.850064

45439276-f1df-499a-a6fd-9d6372c634db
00:12:01.726 --> 00:12:05.642
and then we can. It is called
pair programming. We can

NOTE Confidence: 0.850064

9c9b9b4f-a17b-4983-9568-288e120ef9a3
00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:06.354
program together.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584668

99a939b0-28eb-4910-b151-1462800b3a96
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:13.176
But again. You are in
the computer science discipline.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584668

185fa2da-fa80-4db0-b9eb-52096b8a1928
00:12:13.176 --> 00:12:18.324
You have to master programming
at least in one language. For

f2933856-6419-423e-bf26-8bfc0f92bdeb
00:12:18.324 --> 00:12:23.940
instance, C, Java, C, sharp. I
mean, it's kind of I mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.8584668

fb758775-6bea-49dd-8150-9093c3414d61
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.152
knowing the multiplication of
numbers in I mean primary

e7f9c4cc-d471-4ac9-95c0-c0328a0980a4
00:12:28.152 --> 00:12:33.916
school. So. If you think
that programming is hard or

NOTE Confidence: 0.8869768

773702ca-23ad-40da-8c25-edba972121a9
00:12:33.916 --> 00:12:38.947
difficult for you, I mean at the
only the only solution for that

NOTE Confidence: 0.8869768

f473cd32-9cc0-45b8-8610-ce829e7700cc
00:12:38.947 --> 00:12:43.591
is practicing programming is not
a thing. That is, it is skill.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8869768

e696e3e0-40ed-4acc-9460-4261ef0ecd58
00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:47.848
It's not anything that you
memorize or you just learn how

NOTE Confidence: 0.8869768

13cc0c72-5b18-4fd6-b81c-6abb3daaf0b3
00:12:47.848 --> 00:12:52.879
to solve the problem. You have
to practice. You have to do some

NOTE Confidence: 0.8869768

3c26ed01-9d58-476d-9d0f-fa9145e7b456
00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:56.749
hands-on practice. That's why I
include the programming just to

ead998c8-c3c4-45b0-8734-b2043c08bb9f
00:12:56.749 --> 00:13:01.006
at least motivate you to do
programming at first, if you're.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89088875

d86f9964-1b86-4009-aacd-caead88daa51
00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.286
You have these experience, I
mean very early. You think that

NOTE Confidence: 0.89088875

5ff2d352-297a-4f0b-aeec-e19a6880ee56
00:13:04.286 --> 00:13:08.004
is difficult, but later on you
see that that's very easy. So at

NOTE Confidence: 0.89088875

10db9fc0-69bc-4728-b43a-cc481f33453a
00:13:08.004 --> 00:13:10.006
some point you have to do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.860582

4fb281b5-e5ee-4d37-bd3f-72f0ce03eb3c
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:14.774
I can promise that for those
that is difficult, the program

eb628c83-3253-4ac9-933d-b2136ca5f634
00:13:14.774 --> 00:13:16.718
is are difficult. I mean after.

acf6096f-379e-4357-aaa8-f2e46c4fbd1c
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.455
I mean, more time, more
practice. You can find it. OK,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9031761

992f2f6e-7580-44a3-a3d0-d2e0bc75ee04
00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:24.960
really. But you have to start at

NOTE Confidence: 0.6941078

bd64533c-dd25-4646-8c41-e2b8339f12c0
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.883
some point you know. For those
who think these are too much up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8362269

96834884-40ff-49cf-a2a7-94fd4dbf4322
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.936
As I said, the balance within
the workload within the labs

NOTE Confidence: 0.8362269

d18a8ae9-8ef3-4a51-95f7-0544f0b6b995
00:13:34.936 --> 00:13:38.596
are different. For instance,
for the lab 05, the sign

NOTE Confidence: 0.8362269

829b301e-f837-4a4b-878e-89bf0d4f5215
00:13:38.596 --> 00:13:42.622
magnitude the load was. I
mean a lot, but about the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8362269

2d080b6e-a2ed-4fb7-908d-7feb05679d5a
00:13:42.622 --> 00:13:46.648
next one which is for the
Reading Week is next week

NOTE Confidence: 0.8362269

426807c9-53c7-4283-a883-3274e1c8a52f
00:13:46.648 --> 00:13:50.308
about the Two's complement.
It is very easy and the

c348de94-6d79-4b51-be6e-66dadcc23b94
00:13:50.308 --> 00:13:51.406
reason is that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85152775

e6f0ab01-7569-4e2e-a4a8-aaf1b07f9ca7
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.210
Sometimes the difficulty of the
developed program is depends on

b2744b59-2231-4c60-a43a-1a23684d5e68
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.455
that concept that we thought.

620c6129-9c98-4627-b213-376b7362784e
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.640
So for instance, the Two's
complement is a little bit

NOTE Confidence: 0.70804477

98b26b04-d957-4d70-ab3c-e172404221eb
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.176
 tricky. And little bit hard, but The thing is. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8598212

7f4655e8-4041-4ecf-b76a-c2ea2d43496b
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.430
After you programming that
difficult or that tricky Pro, I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8598212

efc5ade7-a50d-4ee1-b771-e2f8269e14bd
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:17.780
mean concept when you receive a
better solution, you can

48a2a127-9991-4f09-85fd-64859aebafad
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:23.000
understand why this is better or
why this is easier. So before

NOTE Confidence: 0.8598212

8b5fa37e-feb4-41cd-82da-ac4ad8941464
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.915
experiencing some hardship or
some, I mean difficulty, you

00:14:26.915 --> 00:14:30.830
cannot appreciate the nice
property of a better solution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8314359

ef6c51f7-48b2-48a6-81b3-9c0d535e57ed
00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.924
That was, for instance in this.
If you compare the sign

NOTE Confidence: 0.8314359

84a568c6-e8c1-449f-bcd3-3c57e83a7dc5
00:14:34.924 --> 00:14:36.180
magnitude and twos compliment.

b2e4f8ab-3d19-4607-8118-5665b83e414a
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.203
I believe that you can
understand why this company

88ffce43-9d78-4ca0-97a9-02bca7156917
00:14:40.203 --> 00:14:43.219
is much more easier than the
sign magnitude.

43656227-c965-4ccb-b1b3-960040ee2438
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.619
So I think.

511cb630-1c8b-449f-932a-d5309668b22c
00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:53.140
Uh. Sometimes it is too much,
but it's worth it because then

b3c21bcc-d8a4-49b6-9470-53fa8d2b2f11
00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.440
the next assignment or the next
solution is much more easier.

About the uh.

00:15:07.848 --> 00:15:11.080
understanding the concepts and
also practicing your programming

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.928

be9599da-fb57-4cd6-8c9f-8fc682e5e64f
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.248
Please communicate with the

00:15:22.248 --> 00:15:26.659
with me so then we can
discuss, uh, why there's a

8e40cad8-cdce-4cd1-aa8d-b2983672375e
00:15:26.659 --> 00:15:30.669
problem. I saw a lot of
comments about some marking

00:15:30.669 --> 00:15:33.075

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:39.574

you have to think about that

00:19:16.884 --> 00:19:20.712

2c0da13e-5fea-4fa7-9188-aa9aa3d6c596
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.100

but as Southeast student did, so
they put a question in the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8785516

2393dd09-43be-40e5-ae96-5a4c48e37dd8
00:21:29.842 --> 00:21:33.598
discussion board and I tried to
answer right away just to fix

NOTE Confidence: 0.9024129

4b8590a1-ef52-42c9-acda-0d3ebe3137cf
00:21:33.598 --> 00:21:38.130
the confusion. Also, in the lab
section you can attend the lab

NOTE Confidence: 0.9024129

61767763-c149-4339-b2d0-14de79e74ee4
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.749
Section 2 in order to discuss
the confusion or any issue.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83492

cb5a7e83-d633-480b-be7f-c9d80789f1e2
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:47.178
But yes, I mean, send your
feedback and then I. I mean,

NOTE Confidence: 0.83492

a81fdf01-742d-4f6a-a97e-0fae864aa5d1
00:21:47.178 --> 00:21:50.409
gradually I fixed the. So I
mean the manner.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85358477

549eb09f-1c20-4160-8a48-34110bd8bea2
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:56.758
About the putting more detail,
one thing is that right now for

NOTE Confidence: 0.85358477

0418c136-1dca-4cf4-a78b-ed82ea8aced9
00:21:56.758 --> 00:22:01.202
each manual we have two to three
pages of the manner.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9349745

83593162-5781-4eb9-a436-74a6ea51e348
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.890
So.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8530989

4f25c2d4-f412-4304-9e5c-4db85111b848
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.721
If I make it a 10 page
manual, it's kind of a tiring

NOTE Confidence: 0.8530989

238d90b1-1297-4b48-8a28-f6ea7a29d4ca
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:11.045
for you. For each lab you
will read 10 pages of manual

NOTE Confidence: 0.8530989

5429373f-9a68-441a-ba16-3a16da802fc6
00:22:11.045 --> 00:22:12.707
to exactly know what to do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80252755

51922e0e-e004-4233-824e-4a0ebe365832
00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:19.058
So I have to find a trade off. I
mean I have to make it a little

NOTE Confidence: 0.80252755

09da4b10-9fd4-4f85-802b-65a3ef6c7d10
00:22:19.058 --> 00:22:22.586
bit and short and also I have to
explain those important points.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8768156

b37a7349-bc7e-474e-a545-a4d4040d80d5
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:27.854
Another issue is that I I don't
want to limit your creativity,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8768156

c3a1487f-b2b1-495b-a2ef-6c15d527f508
00:22:27.854 --> 00:22:33.584
so I don't want you to to ask
you to do exactly what is step

NOTE Confidence: 0.8768156

199d0c38-f56c-49ca-bbad-7fc55215316a
00:22:33.584 --> 00:22:38.932
on how sometimes I I want to
explain how you what to do but

NOTE Confidence: 0.8768156

b872abdc-a831-436d-8dad-ad1dc826712e
00:22:38.932 --> 00:22:43.898
do not explain how because I
want to let you decide what is

NOTE Confidence: 0.8768156

6b7a31bc-e591-4379-9022-267d56b83485
00:22:43.898 --> 00:22:48.482
the best way to do that. So
sometimes and some some vision.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8768156

2df036e8-d1fe-43cc-956b-bc25ee6cfd58
00:22:48.482 --> 00:22:53.448
I see that easy. I mean creative
idea. Sometimes I put the bonus.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8333838

0f1df6f4-fa14-468a-9857-820ff7953c5f
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.140
Like for that idea and I
didn't expect that some

NOTE Confidence: 0.8333838

58536980-d002-477c-8a67-29f2b965c785
00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.708
student can solve this
problem by this process,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8333838

ea12a84c-7887-4362-9032-104d6d6a7da0
00:23:01.708 --> 00:23:05.722
new idea. So there's a
tradeoff here, but again,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8333838

f03607c1-7d55-4bad-be08-dcc8052ed335
00:23:05.722 --> 00:23:08.844
whenever you see that
there's a confusion.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84185815

0422be1d-a562-48b3-b0ac-ca6a0b46d2ff
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:13.417
Send me feedback. I can correct
that part of the model.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8961136

75595a1b-139d-4b1e-aa34-77f405a25155
00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.042
But yes, I mean I think of it as

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676704

28298535-3dda-485f-9b07-945ebbc9771f
00:23:17.042 --> 00:23:21.358
a balance between. If I put more
detail it limits your

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676704

64c4e620-138e-45f1-a0c3-78591f2c094d
00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:25.329
creativity. If I put less
litter, I mean very very small

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676704

156d2ac2-fdb8-4f39-8d00-5ae48de840c8
00:23:25.329 --> 00:23:29.661
amount of details. There is a
huge amount of confusion, so I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676704

4a464a6b-a700-494e-a450-1a242ae314c7
00:23:29.661 --> 00:23:31.466
have to find a balance.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7006125

6ad8c1aa-a9be-47b9-b2e3-240c4005f8cd
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.720
Uh, but I promise that I
gradually fix these manuals

NOTE Confidence: 0.7006125

e5454cb9-88ab-4a01-ad0a-2589a9174047
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.568
about the dependencies.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85361904

a2563bb1-47cc-44b4-8d2f-f5f5c25cd9fc
00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:46.670
Honestly, I tried my best to
make them independent so such

NOTE Confidence: 0.85361904

fe38efd6-641c-4fa3-8ea3-acd7555c71cc
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:51.990
that we will miss one lap. You
can do another lab as well, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.85361904

27c5937e-5536-45a8-906f-afb70163dc29
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.790
even in the topics there are
some dependencies. For instance,

NOTE Confidence: 0.85361904

ab34b624-3b6a-4c78-8a1c-4b272b95b5c2
00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:01.110
if we don't know the I mean the
basis or the binary system, we

NOTE Confidence: 0.85361904

88e74c11-e682-41c4-9966-732b160b1a5f
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.530
cannot do, for instance, whose
complements or sign magnitude,

NOTE Confidence: 0.85361904

1f0dd011-a9ab-47e1-a987-5eff8d8cdf53
00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:05.670
arithmetic and etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88388646

e15f6c1f-cb36-4daf-8942-21759a78f967
00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:09.867
So the dependency is because of
the dependence on the topics.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8527117

ca05d5fe-b684-4bc2-82eb-32bfe72a174b
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:15.372
I tried to make them independent
but there my there is some very

e3b737be-d82f-4f4a-920d-29efc4947195
00:24:15.372 --> 00:24:18.488
small dependency.
Uh, and one thing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8780835

d96cf78e-c865-41e0-b479-9b08aa637e64
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:24.680
I checked the labs and if you
miss one lab.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553792

4dd574f3-64d4-4884-b7a4-57f35398734b
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:30.280
You are still able to do the
next lab, so it's not in a way

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553792

44312c28-1a7e-469c-a336-94e5d0de47dc
00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:35.290
that if you miss one lab you are
not able to do other labs. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553792

31925395-6b6f-4fea-8c7f-9b0541404ce1
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:39.298
although you have to do some
part of the previous lab, but

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553792

96af06b9-59d5-4acf-bbaa-d5a9b4330be2
00:24:39.298 --> 00:24:43.640
it's not that much. I mean you
have enough time to cover some

NOTE Confidence: 0.8553792

d605df8a-9aa1-49c6-a6fa-3dbf3dc3517b
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:45.644
part of the last. I mean

NOTE Confidence: 0.81790125

60396da2-15c1-41bd-b7a2-126872387f9d
00:24:45.644 --> 00:24:49.540
previous lab. But
this is not mean.

689a7bc1-d35c-4cd3-8963-1c1dc0bb6a1e
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:53.607
Because the topics are
dependent on each other, I

ed18ca2f-478c-4c82-bfff-ceea9a797e41
00:24:53.607 --> 00:24:55.172
cannot do anything about
that.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.190
But I agree that the
dependency between labs are

ded17623-a489-4dec-9e1b-bd95a95927ba
00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.820
not a good thing because
anymore for each lab must be

e4675568-2cae-4036-8132-dfbf095e37b3
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:06.780
based on that lab. But on
that is on the previous labs.

b4353d15-6f97-4dcb-a409-18166b3ea50d
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.543
Uh, about the more resource

an ask for any help.

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:24.160
So.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6864701

76bc83d3-e4d3-4223-b4a3-7309160d8078
00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.988

c1221918-6d60-42a4-95de-0dad41d8c5a0
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.996
One thing is that I already
received some marks that in the

fdf42d38-aa82-4d3f-b2fe-18145c08f161
00:25:40.996 --> 00:25:44.692
reading with the the students

00:25:44.692 --> 00:25:48.388
term exam. So usually the
students prefer not to do a lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.84086627

00:25:48.388 --> 00:25:52.700
of work in the reading. That's
why they asked us not to put any

NOTE Confidence: 0.84086627

7daa7082-4fd5-497e-9e3f-29345b9b09ac
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.932

47dd5b70-0e73-4dc9-909c-f59fd70ea032
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:02.325
Is student asked me to put the
those? I'm in labs that are

00:26:02.325 --> 00:26:06.940
harder in the reading week,
but I mean I mean most of this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8579432

5927efa0-cdef-4b2c-8c86-c51d0dc57fec
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.555
one do not like that because
they want to have free time to

2853912e-28ca-44cc-9de8-1f58d4c9db5e
00:26:11.555 --> 00:26:15.460
other rest after the seven

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:19.720
on the mid term exams. So
that's why I put a minimum

And the connection between the
labs and lecture topics. I think

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.410
there is a huge connection

or we want you to investigate

9d377bac-0de5-4025-bcb3-ed126e397dff
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:39.535

that George Boole proposed the

00:41:20.563 --> 00:41:24.133
use his algebra is a Boolean

algebra. So technically,
switching algebra is a Boolean

10d9004b-246f-4b1f-8aec-9f900c2781d7
00:41:28.659 --> 00:41:33.329

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:38.770
But what's the benefit? We
said that by using the

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.580
able to prove some theory.

4a329e0b-05b6-4a66-badb-380fd74326dc
00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:48.934
And then when we can prove these
theories, we can use these

4a4095b8-4344-4eaf-8e12-5410f03fbb5c

theories to simplify the 2nd.

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:57.050
So we are at the second step how
what? What are those here is and

how can we prove those theories

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.144
So the first supposed to prove

d02e2dbb-0832-4692-bb57-bcc3ae2332dc
00:42:07.144 --> 00:42:11.064

c0374fe2-f236-4bcc-8305-bf3193cdef65
00:42:11.064 --> 00:42:14.984
Basically when you want to prove

you could say that there is a

00:42:36.923 --> 00:42:40.413

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:46.294
Well, since the way you proves

bc069502-9547-4102-915d-e428a5445d60

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:57.061
What is another way to prove
them by using the postulate?

00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:01.230

cb08d7de-2a57-4841-aafc-64f49cffdefd

cc92708a-1934-42d1-b4ec-71ce5bfd4397
00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.430
So here is an example.

17fd7397-6134-4cd3-bcfe-0b261788a0ae
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:14.084
We already knew that if you or

if you do that end times X or X
or X and etc. Basically if you

c69beb9a-9b30-44e7-916f-b780b201f850
00:43:27.908 --> 00:43:33.524

We already know that.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:40.440
You could prove this by truth

66f51513-3ba5-4836-8105-02389bdf72c3
00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:44.850

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.090
 this by customers? Because postulate sometimes easier

74e7b46b-f3ea-44cc-8dec-9c8d4b1f5117
00:43:47.090 --> 00:43:48.370
than the truth table.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:55.011
For instance, if the truth, they
will have more than 3, four or

00:43:55.011 --> 00:43:59.775
five input variables, the number
of rows are very huge, so you

aa8ed190-3869-4ed1-8cfa-8751213be711
00:43:59.775 --> 00:44:04.539
 have to check all these rows. It is difficult. That's why we

3c63ea80-9b28-458c-b58a-7294c54df2d9
00:44:04.539 --> 00:44:07.715
use the postulate sometimes. So
for this equation.

b12eb4f0-97df-4c3e-b01e-af0882a488ad
00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:15.134
Basically, you could say that
you could start from the left

bfca2d07-c5d8-49c6-bde9-0ebb85f45504
00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:27.368
Why? Because because of the

Because anything is one is

And then. You can rewrite

you're allowed to use the theory

we are good to use them for

before I prove the theory for

what is duality.

If you are given a Boolean
expression F.

And changing anyone with zero

If you see zero, make it 1.

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:08.610
Before that, let's do some
practice. For instance, if you

So again, in the next

the only thing changes is the

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.356
If you are asked to calculate

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:22.214

00:59:39.157 --> 00:59:42.862

1412da0e-9dc7-4dd5-bca3-3387aa8dd874
01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:22.352

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.294
Basically, this function
is equal to Z. You don't

82ef7a22-ddec-4e51-9d62-53d34d146b36

need any gate for that.

69cb2feb-d174-400f-959c-80048d95eebb
01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:04.597
So although you have XY&Z in the
input of the circuit.

5d99b7d2-d5b9-459b-b91e-f8bbe19abee4

But the output only look at
the Z the the output of the

X&Y doesn't matter.

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:20.154
You could do another proof using
the absorption, you could say

d7fc3f69-67c1-41f5-b0a2-559215b09bbf
01:12:20.154 --> 01:12:22.912
that Z is repeated in all the

01:12:22.912 --> 01:12:27.654
midterms. All of them can be

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:33.666
This is by the absorption

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.980
And this is another example.

01:12:43.670 --> 01:12:46.838
For instance, if this is
the Boolean expression,

e7d79c84-8a81-4eaf-9644-d988bdf4c8de
01:12:46.838 --> 01:12:48.818
 this is the minterm 4.

This is minterm

Six and this is Mr One.

01:12:58.940 --> 01:13:00.960
We need 3 ants.

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.552
Each one has three inputs and
then over them together. So we

27a6577b-4958-458c-a9e8-dc80075f3ed6
01:13:05.552 --> 01:13:07.418
need one or with three inputs.

bdb0f543-d12b-4f60-9c77-459ff8517703
01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:15.780
So here you can see that Z and
explore is repeated so you can

NOTE Confidence: 0.866006

e9b757f9-6bb7-4286-8868-e7c2c1d25866
01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:17.630
extract them and then compliment

52c7aa26-2ebe-43ef-8b47-00313ec8bc63
01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:28.962
So you end up with only one
and here 2 and here, so one

9429ec48-8404-4353-a9dd-008d23ebecff

and two input one and three

01:13:33.692 --> 01:13:39.841
together. So you need one or
two input, so it is much more

NOTE Confidence: 0.866016

b4325a14-b3b5-4520-9ff9-fad6aad61622
01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:42.206
simpler than your original

01:13:59.781 --> 01:14:06.599
simplify a design from the very

957517b3-6773-467f-bebe-9d4001bbaf58

01:14:09.034 --> 01:14:13.639
problem. And then we have to
design A circuit for that. What

3c605601-ce15-4fa1-b259-d321a87e0e9b
01:14:13.639 --> 01:14:17.786
was the step we have to create
the truth table? We have to

3cfca783-67ff-4cd6-bd06-09c2081e44c3
01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:22.252
decide whether we want to design
it based on the SOP or POS and

3040cbd5-7d28-4b8a-8b1f-a0dd98d41735
01:14:22.252 --> 01:14:26.080
then based on those design that
have less number of kids, we

a81754c3-7154-462a-b634-10cac368cfc3
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.313
choose PEO S or SOP and then.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7530527

e2cb46e4-ab02-481e-92f0-8fbce03bc3ce
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:33.196
We want to use the Boolean
algebra to minimize it more.

5b7fcd69-fea3-4ec8-8321-d1e1509e773d
01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.280
So I want to explain that in
this example. So a design recap

e51269a5-7523-4e6d-a331-b155d9f91822
01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.560
from the very first.

edc7aede-79dc-4437-a0d9-8d4c7a4be347
01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:47.480
So imagine we have this problem.
We are asked to write a

2d345cb2-5835-45ed-83d7-c130f960349d
01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:54.280
comparator. Computer is that we
give 2 numbers and the circuit

9cc564d0-20b1-4c66-af0c-734b0940073a
01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.969
basically outputs one.

ffd04843-0dff-4a0b-bc83-cf1f58a74952
01:14:56.630 --> 01:15:02.174
Or 10 underline or open the door
if the first input is greater or

e2f42d19-12c9-424e-bbd3-df73e796af3e
01:15:02.174 --> 01:15:04.154
equal than the second input.

f2698b4b-6ceb-4b0a-a75a-bc7ec685f350
01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:07.432
This is the problem and we want
to design a second for that.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.546
As I said, you have to explain
how many inputs you have, how

NOTE Confidence: 0.8727525

3ceec857-d16e-41f4-a9d2-dae3161a3a04
01:15:13.546 --> 01:15:14.994
many output you have.

01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:20.570
So first of all, you have to see
that what are the X&Y? What is

7f0c0fdb-677a-4496-a1e5-7857eafb0338
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:22.170
the range of the X&Y?

44f8e002-83d1-4ca5-8612-645b8f9fd9c3
01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:26.860
The question says that the
X&Y are between zero and

NOTE Confidence: 0.89324915

d469b3fa-1135-4f36-a72c-23bd86259185

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:33.164
And we are going to design a
second in binary system. So we

1f51c4cf-f207-440e-862f-86bf76ac3ebe
01:15:33.164 --> 01:15:35.180
have to convert the range to the

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:39.804
binary system. Any number
between zero and three. If you

e8ada8e7-254e-4a83-9f39-80fcafb4b562
01:15:39.804 --> 01:15:44.134
change it to the binary system,
it is between 0001.

10 and then 11.

e7fcba3f-e46f-4475-b9c2-b959d41682fc
01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:52.344
So you need two bids for X.

4ae4545c-6d1e-429f-8caf-37ed0df300ef

339c0c96-7fea-432b-a762-1dff375d0d2c
01:15:55.090 --> 01:16:01.660
In total you need 4 bits, 12 M
4X12M4 Y in the input. So for

231da862-aaa2-4642-98d9-1a1d6992f31b
01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:06.916
instance in the input you are
going to receive zero and one

c4b3b3bb-a250-4817-aeac-fa197d32b785
01:16:06.916 --> 01:16:14.178
4X. You are going to receive 11

01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:19.729
equal than why you had put one.
Otherwise we output 0. Here this

c76d7493-5750-442f-99ee-1c743a101ea9
01:16:19.729 --> 01:16:23.999

01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:28.530
Because X is lower than Y.

ffa0fbba-d2b6-43db-a683-dbd73c0af1ab
01:16:31.130 --> 01:16:35.150
So the output how many output
you need in this question is

4fda2964-cedc-4c6e-9527-0cfcf65035c6
01:16:35.150 --> 01:16:38.835
simply says that if it is
greater or equal output one.

eee2bbf9-b81d-4add-a624-172e41c28f7a
01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:42.218
 Otherwise, output Zero, so there's only two situations,

3aa1cf28-db52-4da5-b53f-aa4aa5492eef
01:16:42.218 --> 01:16:46.651
zero and one. So the number of

fe71c9c3-61fd-42b7-8e09-9c9a488f2567
01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:55.028
And then you have to form the
truth table. Truth table has the

e7ee36ca-ad71-4328-94df-1b4319556171
01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:05.284
 And then why 2 numbers? Each one has two case and one output

8f4643f2-8029-40a7-acb8-19da25fb90e6
01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:13.250
zero and one. And then you have to fill out the whole table so the

01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:04.410
And then you have to design it
by. So you have to fill out all

24ea357e-ca3f-4a61-8ffb-b678aae4057c
01:18:04.410 --> 01:18:06.342

01:18:06.342 --> 01:18:10.908
can see here. Then you have
to decide whether you did

5 meters, six with them. Seven.
As you can see here.

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:43.712
Or you can look at those into
it. That makes the output zero

406d634e-6102-4b52-b67d-063252291d86
01:18:43.712 --> 01:18:45.700
and write it by the PEO S.

01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:50.590
So maxterm. This is the master.

This is the master.

01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:02.674
8 annotators so you can see that
these are the maxims those

a6264319-b4d8-41ea-bfb5-d490733ace2b
01:19:02.674 --> 01:19:05.056

e752bb75-921f-41ce-b68d-8e1595802231
01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:08.630
Now you have to decide
which one do you choose.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9009831

aae2b083-e976-49a0-87c3-4bf2a6810f1d
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:10.055
So which one you choose?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8954976

ea9ff332-7a41-4fe0-bbfa-848696137038
01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:13.750
Anybody?

08373045-936c-40b5-a95d-fc5455de058d
01:19:18.210 --> 01:19:21.770
Correct, Philip, because as
you can see here, the number

bfb1389d-7ddb-4fb5-bb10-29320c00287e
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:25.686
 of maxterms or just one 23456 the number of minterms are

0d1784df-a52c-4222-9e29-3f2495db1b7e
01:19:25.686 --> 01:19:30.314
more than that. So the number
of kids you are going to use

NOTE Confidence: 0.8326503

00abd207-da04-4c0b-ab5d-f9306b5fb325
01:19:30.314 --> 01:19:34.586
in next terms or QoS is less.
So you decide this one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84771794

a7f27820-fc91-4a22-8eeb-c45669c73905
01:19:37.150 --> 01:19:42.130
So when you want to design, both
of them are correct or

NOTE Confidence: 0.84771794

8324c08a-08da-4ca9-b186-66c3b3eb014f
01:19:42.130 --> 01:19:47.110
effective. Both of them are with
the same speed because they have

d1f4b0e0-f688-48ce-9b7c-04befffd7ed9
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:48.770
two levels of gates.

dd9e2011-c5ca-48b5-8b18-b6da31d10be4
01:19:49.490 --> 01:19:51.890
But in terms of the
number of gates.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8175403

41a51a65-6542-473f-91cd-db2ccb06106b
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:57.214
Uh, if you count them the number
of ends you need, the number or

05c042d4-14e4-4acb-b0f9-de91523d43ef
01:19:57.214 --> 01:20:00.526
the number of nuts if you want
to design it by now.

fbe8c55d-e97c-4d30-8a79-7c69ae2e34f3
01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:04.852
Only or not. Only how many
games you need in the SOP

495a4761-9624-4450-8e4b-b47c94076457

aeb9a38c-4b75-4d1a-aad0-00b66d43a58d
01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:10.850
If you calculate them, you end
up with this numbers.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8734726

a9fb3233-c82e-4f57-8554-f15f2b851e50
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:13.136
In the Max time, you're gonna

c89fd3d6-7083-429c-9659-676dccf3c0c4
01:20:13.136 --> 01:20:18.632
have only 6. Or because you have
6 Max terms, but here you have

NOTE Confidence: 0.82333165

4165e149-7441-455b-8cfb-f1a17cf7cb64
01:20:18.632 --> 01:20:21.236
10 meters each one need an end.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87220323

54b44a58-aeb1-4fa1-8950-fb26300d40e2
01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:27.108
 So we can calculate the other number of gates, but just for 

NOTE Confidence: 0.87220323

bead147e-127c-4d40-9ba1-30f63205edfd
01:20:27.108 --> 01:20:30.114
this you can see that the
maximum is better.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80253345

2fe7daae-3548-4b6e-9d67-65120f3ec66d
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:37.866
And you design it by Maxterms.
So here is the design. You can

NOTE Confidence: 0.80253345

290f82cf-4656-4c7d-bcf3-1681296b95b1
01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:41.958
have a look at home, very
similar to the previous designs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9243278

c7aefff0-c5e3-4c4c-bcf4-9cfa7693ac80
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:44.788
But now the question is that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8551982

f4915f17-392e-4bd1-9bab-e55c19419493
01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.090
What if I want to simplify this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.93062794

cecc08b7-278a-42df-b2c7-802edbef0ed5
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:57.988
So you have to simplify
this expression.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85384774

82bca6a1-088f-4cd9-a6fc-2a529af7e99a
01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.400
This is not an easy task. You
know it's I mean, but it doesn't

NOTE Confidence: 0.85384774

29e0fd6e-d55f-4a39-ad2f-b6f3bebd6dc7
01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.080
have just one or two Max terms

NOTE Confidence: 0.7751923

b05eb870-a504-42ae-b861-2a61c80a1a5c
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:11.752
it has. How many six weeks Max
terms and each Maxim says 4

NOTE Confidence: 0.91888815

4d86ef85-4784-401f-9ad1-3f3674b82385
01:21:11.752 --> 01:21:14.548
binary variables.
So let's start.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80729115

3caf0d6f-aa22-4877-a186-82143481de68
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:21.153
So then base is this. You can
make it dual out of F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7877567

f9e4ba04-eb3c-4981-aceb-2974102b48b7
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:22.889
Which becomes this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.88166064

4837f47b-0808-4135-a7ab-0bf181eda00a
01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:28.754
And then try to simplify the
dual and at the end you bring it

NOTE Confidence: 0.88166064

db083c32-4708-4f0c-b264-67f188489410
01:21:28.754 --> 01:21:30.259
back to the original form.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8414422

1d8dec47-9e53-45d9-bc52-e203482bb629
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:33.410
So let's simplify
the dual of that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85407275

c8853d8d-8a63-43c4-bbe7-fcb1156a4c05
01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:39.000
So here you can see that in
the second theater there is

63acd600-8bc8-478d-981a-09ca74c3c140
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.015
some. There is some overlap.
You can extract this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86187714

6de10831-f941-48c6-b88c-f7233b7bd124
01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:47.980
If you extract that, you can see
there is a complement form

NOTE Confidence: 0.86187714

5d6a70e0-fbf0-41d5-86b6-eadf70d31c79
01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.955
appears, so it becomes one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7970078

01:21:51.250 --> 01:21:56.463
And then you can. You could ask
that. OK, I simplify that one

NOTE Confidence: 0.7970078

f0eb55e6-f955-416d-85a1-5a199320f2a4
01:21:56.463 --> 01:21:58.468
step, so I'll be done.

f8843a66-737c-4b2a-9213-9a5472756cd4
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:07.408
I could say that you can add this term again here because

4a24efc7-32a9-4881-9147-dfd57f2d8a96
01:22:07.408 --> 01:22:12.928
by the. Theory X + X
is equal to X.

ed1471f1-0dfc-415b-a3d7-8c734764d070
01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:19.800
We can add the existing term
that already use. Simplify

NOTE Confidence: 0.8727786

edc08f6c-b804-4e9e-b62f-7f7c5d6385f7
01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:25.420
that again. Why we do that?
Because it introduces another

01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:25.982
simplification.

20aee067-d13d-4fdb-8cd4-50537e6b4990
01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.030
As you can see here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8774062

7a04daf1-be36-4744-860c-2f8c221ccf14
01:22:29.650 --> 01:22:34.087
And then another compliment for,
and then this one.

da0fc733-0c00-4068-ad70-9a546bb65766
01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.160
So you could ask me that are we

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.620
done now? I could say that.

01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:47.053
I don't know. You can think more
and then try to simplify more.

4830804e-981c-4d44-95af-06fe857e5baa
01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:51.120
So. That's the problem.

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:04.705
Also, you have to bring

do another dual.

01:23:25.768 --> 01:23:31.346
these. That's the main problem

have to be a smart.

we do more simplification?

01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:16.524
So it depends on the genius of
