00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:27.082
So is there any other questions?
Can we please get solutions to

An added key, the key for
the assignments. So

928d5ca8-ee71-4537-9de0-e0e1151f3434
00:08:36.565 --> 00:08:40.660
 basically now that we have the marks for lab

943e97d6-b8bc-4c71-a3f5-978481dfdb0d
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.368
 I will release the key for lab 2

a5cc0cc1-81c2-4924-bb06-c93eb39d45be
00:08:47.368 --> 00:08:51.058
because sometimes I extend the
deadlines for some students, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.8628952

b18682fd-c6ca-45c9-ae4f-1af0eb1846be
00:08:51.058 --> 00:08:55.855
I have to wait for them to

00:08:55.855 --> 00:09:00.283
the key. But as I said,
sometimes you don't have the key

NOTE Confidence: 0.8628952

27007d41-5300-4be4-a116-45f0d9d40b1d
00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:05.080
for all questions. You only have
the keys for. I mean those that

00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:12.980
answer them. So if you see
that, for instance we have 10

bb8ea022-e334-4e28-a818-813db7eee81b
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:55.350

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.970
The design is that we are given

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:10.611
a problem. And we have to design

00:10:10.611 --> 00:10:14.260
for that. Uh, and we said that.

4baaa206-7a1c-4b8b-b73a-e6fce2137982
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.934
I go to them or a step by step
manual to design any logic

afe47e43-893d-4c43-accd-735700682784
00:10:21.934 --> 00:10:23.558
circuit for any problems.

b157a9a9-4188-415e-9d3a-67cbbac3fa5e
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.270
Uh, in order to do that, we
introduced the midterms.

can be represented by some of

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.468
 minterms. Minterms was the. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8168593

554b78cb-80a5-4df3-bdae-25142995d446
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.382
At the end, within the binary

NOTE Confidence: 0.8398867

a51d7e14-a731-4bed-9349-831d21975624
00:10:43.382 --> 00:10:48.560
variables. Such that it makes
the output of 1. So basically

NOTE Confidence: 0.8398867

050c9d49-127d-4926-a202-073a200ee531
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.268
 there is a relationship between minterms and truth table. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8176308

eec1daf4-da8c-4dd8-9527-4f4a0fc0ebc8
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.899
 And then we said that when we write the boolen, the 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8176308

6808f5b1-66dd-4300-b382-7be380841217
00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:01.490
output in the truth table
based on the midterms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7704029

ecf05c43-6152-4dc0-be01-cf6e495f63de
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.820
And, uh, to level at first level
we do and.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8280515

e107a779-ac2d-400b-97e8-5fe6c983065a
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.890
Basically the products by
product we mean ending and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.8280515

2af0a9a7-56f7-4865-9d5e-506b99c0a1ec
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:19.285
the result of these ants become
or together. So one final or at

NOTE Confidence: 0.8280515

c48f7170-3d03-466e-8585-4beea46336bf
00:11:19.285 --> 00:11:25.510
the end. As a result, for the OR
we say that we use the symbol

NOTE Confidence: 0.8280515

8a5fd635-9e0a-4d15-9e36-e240f8c5ad3d
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:30.490
plus, so that's why we call it
some. So design the logic

NOTE Confidence: 0.8280515

d7628c8a-4dd4-4c89-9900-d5b4a52b1845
00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:35.055
 circuit based on the minterms becomes the sum of products or 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8280515

a21f8bc4-26e2-4808-9d82-ec571eda8b6d
00:11:35.055 --> 00:11:39.620
we do products and then we sum them together or SOP

NOTE Confidence: 0.77860904

631f9bd7-56eb-457f-a035-869163d08f64
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.410
Or we Add all the inputs,
those inputs that makes

91ec9769-37a9-44df-ae51-e9b755cdc807
00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:46.510
the output one and then.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8342347

84ade96e-7338-48c2-874a-51fa40ef2754
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.690
For them to better. So basically
two level logic 2nd.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87921995

405642a1-1ba0-41be-a6bb-bc9f192776ed
00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:59.615
So here is an example. Just to
remind you about the this design

NOTE Confidence: 0.8408535

f4e9861c-4756-417c-ad35-e7ffa897f351
00:11:59.615 --> 00:12:04.990
algorithm. So imagine we have a
truth table in the left side. We

NOTE Confidence: 0.8408535

175adcab-a849-4025-8f37-12b7abde17c3
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.540
have the binary variables as the
inputs in the right side we have

NOTE Confidence: 0.8408535

edbcc74e-5e2c-4c15-b79a-e1f76e0b0944
00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.740
the binder variables at as the
output. So we have only one

NOTE Confidence: 0.8408535

50a12e04-1936-411c-af39-88157625f680
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.890
binary variable as the output.
We called this Boolean

NOTE Confidence: 0.8408535

6d5797a0-072d-4e82-8018-985c31e1df0d
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.390
expression or Boolean function F
as a function of XYZ.

1c2982ad-8b69-41c1-9819-73cc88410e5c
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.527
So we see that whenever XYZ
are all zero, the art of this

NOTE Confidence: 0.82148314

21877bbb-4ef9-4b06-b711-eb60268f98be
00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:29.674
one. Whenever here Francis X
is 1 Y is 1 and Z0. The

488b8019-883a-476b-9223-cad062f12604
00:12:29.674 --> 00:12:31.269
output is 1 and etc.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8693409

887e2263-7e1c-4b08-ad32-fa429e17f280
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:33.888
Also for these three.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7239818

f51e25ed-4f5b-441e-ba1a-1456fbfb053d
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.190
When we want to design.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74586993

5fc3481b-c32a-44fc-bf9f-01ab9f6b07c6
00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:42.914
 So we said before minterms we only look at those entries. That 

NOTE Confidence: 0.74586993

bd864e46-db94-4050-babb-236c045d95c8
00:12:42.914 --> 00:12:44.799
makes up one. So here.

2f0b32d6-2b12-4082-9aa4-4ba8f5f1dd11
00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.218
Here. And these two here.

fa14217e-fe88-41e5-a5a9-866ab8c1f2ba
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:55.104
And then we said that we can
write the Boolean function F as

901f69aa-bd99-4d24-80f5-e94df3fe5a2b
00:12:55.104 --> 00:12:59.592
some of the minterms and these minterms are those minterms that

4aaf4d38-b5c8-4c77-bcd9-aa0d388eebd9
00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:03.672
makes the output one. For

e753d076-d189-415b-83e5-1ec4eb98be80
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:14.002
What's the new term? The term is
0 if put the zero binary value

bea9feef-0f7a-4112-842b-d6ceacfbd0d4

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.565
Free entries here mean that
if you put the binary value

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.690
that if you put the binary value for free,

dca8a68f-4bc6-49f0-a709-893ecdb97650
00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:24.615
it makes the output one or here
here is 101 which is 5 so many

c6efdf86-fbc7-4a21-819d-edcf719e3a83
00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:29.750
that minterm five and here 110 which is 6 so minterm six.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.610

Boolean function. For

268a2901-522b-4ac4-a2b5-56f3fbc2120b
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:39.807
As an example, here is the truth
table that has one.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.260
Output function this is the
previous truth table. Imagine we

efaae127-0e14-41e3-91f7-6da6d8249ba0
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.510
have another. Here is the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8179902

5bde8090-7f84-4aa9-bbea-feb8e4f6ad1a
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:56.000
design. Imagine we have another
function F2 that for the same

NOTE Confidence: 0.8179902

0d0283c1-3460-4c84-baeb-119a2ca74595
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.180
series of input. For instance
XYZ. But this function F2

NOTE Confidence: 0.8179902

933d9d9a-2078-4101-8655-2fad6e24055e
00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:08.978
becomes one only for these
midterms midterm 100 which is 4

NOTE Confidence: 0.8179902

71a4b0ac-5650-492d-996b-3a919f9514c5
00:18:08.978 --> 00:18:10.832
 and minterm 5. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.82812333

4b61dc73-b3ec-46ba-acd0-e5e2f15cded8
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.752
 So this is a totally different 2's table with another, I mean 

NOTE Confidence: 0.82812333

fe8c5c0a-d97d-410a-a2d7-9306951f65c2
00:18:16.752 --> 00:18:21.324
a function F2 that makes that
becomes one for only mid term,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82812333

6608fec4-ecf4-4ecf-a740-c33b52d6a582
00:18:21.324 --> 00:18:22.467
four and five.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79972595

e537da25-cbf1-49b5-bf6a-979b133a12ec
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:31.184
So one way is that we can,
and here's the design. So F2 is

NOTE Confidence: 0.79972595

844771ed-f6d5-4112-ace4-ef4344f4c3f3
00:18:31.184 --> 00:18:38.548
 a minterm x bar y bar and Z which is 4 and XYZ which is 5 

NOTE Confidence: 0.79972595

33422145-22fe-4131-a03b-083d10ed4ed2
00:18:38.548 --> 00:18:43.808
and then and then and then and
then order together.

NOTE Confidence: 0.793005

2a1d8696-2412-4106-ae9d-76dcabd671be
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:50.440
 So one thing always this in 1 2's table we put both functions 

NOTE Confidence: 0.793005

46ced7a7-95e5-46d7-9d51-f11ee4c622fe
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:56.225
because the inputs are the same
for both functions. So XY and Z

NOTE Confidence: 0.793005

a8ba0d67-d667-4c8c-83c5-f5c72432483c
00:18:56.225 --> 00:19:00.675
so we can merge these two
through stable into one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5827255

a8b0fbd3-4215-48bf-8e05-c5e62ac5660b
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.070
Behind

NOTE Confidence: 0.74066645

732e80b4-9bc2-438e-9583-afb6e5ed55f6
00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:12.232
 F1 Z minterm 0356 as before and F2 is Sigma minterm four and five. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.81563264

200965d7-5852-4455-a58c-bc89c3151714
00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:18.823
So why this is good? The reason
is that you can merge the

NOTE Confidence: 0.81563264

9cbe5c34-4eaa-4b5c-89a6-ec468c5ad3fc
00:19:18.823 --> 00:19:22.031
circuit for these two functions
into one circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.821168

d3b46ddd-106b-49c7-bcf7-a93f19d7f209
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:28.188
And here is the result. So
basically you have XY&Z. Each of

NOTE Confidence: 0.821168

7f2cc626-0c83-4b82-8c1d-87b21235d807
00:19:28.188 --> 00:19:34.404
them has in the normal form and in the compliment for. So as you

NOTE Confidence: 0.821168

678df9b1-885e-4c0e-a147-10d7c6846c18
00:19:34.404 --> 00:19:36.624
 can see here minterm 5. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.6248798

b5a0b5dc-279e-4fc1-95a1-599a1b822d61
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.330
here it yes minterm 5. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.7676861

254b7605-a3d4-4942-b419-13b2cc9c97d5
00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.410
Uh. Oh, let me know
this one. Yes yes

NOTE Confidence: 0.7676861

2f1f157a-7c86-4fe3-bf7a-7c804a6de91a
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.850
 midterm 5 minterm 5 repeated in F2 and 

NOTE Confidence: 0.7676861

81659d57-89b4-47f6-b985-890da332f1e8
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.515
also in F1.

NOTE Confidence: 0.70463514

7092f151-8181-463a-8a2e-2757e72de86c
00:19:56.290 --> 00:20:00.106
 Put that one circuit. This is the minterm file. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.78768283

610306f4-c72a-4f0c-b194-553bda57cfa6
00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.200
So XY bar and Z.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82411546

82b7fdf9-7cac-4e53-ace3-7c2d90842758
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.385
So not only we can use the result of the this for the

NOTE Confidence: 0.82411546

457ca253-78bb-4373-95fc-0e84730768b3
00:20:08.385 --> 00:20:12.180
first function, also we can use
it for the second function.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8361111

753e56b1-f43d-481c-a227-6b17cfc7ade3
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:19.664
So if you merge the two table
into 1 two stable and then merge

NOTE Confidence: 0.8361111

9b0eef65-9a95-4485-b6f6-a57ee34fdeb0
00:20:19.664 --> 00:20:24.424
the circuits into one circuit,
there's a probability that you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8361111

04a70ad4-cc03-41a1-ae02-7c5df9cf736f
00:20:24.424 --> 00:20:30.612
 can reuse the minterms in both circuits, as you can see here in 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8361111

cbca33db-5bbf-4f08-9965-fc2bec34a185
00:20:30.612 --> 00:20:36.800
 this minterm, it and five is also using F1 and also have two. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8361111

937599ee-1da7-42c2-a1ab-1c6bb4908d27
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:42.512
So this is 1 shorter way to
design circuits. So whenever you

NOTE Confidence: 0.8361111

6371485f-1a28-4aa7-98b5-e62b7ea6f2a9
00:20:42.512 --> 00:20:44.892
see is saying series of.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8239792

0f5af442-92bf-4b35-b809-3ee8b8939625
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.776
 Inputs in the for instance XYZ and you want to design different 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8239792

a7878152-b922-479e-88fc-9ffa573b7767
00:20:49.776 --> 00:20:55.444
Boolean functions out of the XY
and Z. We can put all the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8239792

006db638-aed9-49d0-9169-c8d9a6cbe190
00:20:55.444 --> 00:21:00.676
Boolean function is 1 truth
table and then you can design it

NOTE Confidence: 0.8239792

852392e3-a1eb-48d1-98c3-7ac5d0cd796b
00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:05.472
 in one logic circuit because you can reuse the same minterms

NOTE Confidence: 0.8051666

c9988c8f-b293-4035-8a79-b13cd4a7c976
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.280
 Well, another way would be you can list all the minterms 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8051666

6434f0cd-67fd-4ee5-a6d0-38fe5b882da0
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.080
available midterms in the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.8451952

f16f446d-fd5b-4aea-b356-85fe29d697b4
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.790
 level. And only use those minterms that are needed for you 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8451952

0005a663-3a2c-4c00-b5d8-5325f9e4833e
00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:19.912
for the OR.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7438425

ae59562b-69ff-4bce-85a5-d0d0cbced3e7
00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.883
 So I could for instance putting meet them, zero midterm, 1 

NOTE Confidence: 0.7438425

9d55ecef-27c1-492b-b831-6d7a927bff3e
00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:27.564
 minterm, 2 up until minterm 7. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.870512

0b72584c-1655-4d3c-a130-1cbb7d6cd422
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.110
But only use the output
of those meters that are

NOTE Confidence: 0.870512

1c374dfa-8840-4d55-8398-ba4c48aedb95
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.106
needed for my function.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8806085

f0513320-ca07-4f8e-869b-85f29628965f
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.296
This is another way to design.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9120852

b8db3455-fda8-4c56-931a-80e29126087d
00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:47.367
So let's do a practice on a new
one. Here is the problem.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8605947

45de6189-e312-40ba-b94c-571d8f069dd7
00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.038
So so far we assume that the
truth table is given an will

NOTE Confidence: 0.8605947

65c24711-73c3-4461-bbb9-b6f6e33542cc
00:21:52.038 --> 00:21:55.294
 what is sum of minterms. But imagine this problem. I mean 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8605947

5571ad22-1546-4b1f-8f67-12b60e360f7a
00:21:55.294 --> 00:21:59.142
assume that we have this problem
but we are not given the truth

NOTE Confidence: 0.9057571

7ec8fab8-612a-46fc-80cb-7bc21cdab1e8
00:21:59.142 --> 00:22:01.800
table. So basically it says that

NOTE Confidence: 0.76837116

e64edcec-ce44-4b0a-9fea-2ef9d1df909c
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:07.550
we wanted this. Circuit
that outputs the division

a295dc62-850c-407a-9e53-8a1b57b6aa1d
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.064
the remainder of.

9d1f2753-4aac-45c4-b2e3-e210e1787a19
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.640
Any number divided by three.

4d9e4234-98f5-4a6b-8ac6-ae41959e97d6
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:22.019
So this is the problem. Now
we want to design. I mean I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8671574

6cfce3d6-6c6d-45f3-a52b-c93caff29106
00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:25.902
finally wanna design A logic
circuit and we give it to

e41815de-540e-4ad4-a72d-c26605472391

441c175b-57a5-4b70-81bb-f08e338dfbde
00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:37.058
So the first question is that so
far we know how to design A

d43ae3b8-7415-4ad2-ba5c-bf2f15e0aa91
00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:41.402
 circuit by minterms, so we have to 1st create the truth table. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.759082

c37ea512-9951-422a-9800-a47f40346f5d
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.470
 And then based on the table, we write the minterms and then we

617e50bb-b654-4b55-9d20-7354e325ae8c
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:49.520
discuss the circuit.

a6d8f84e-1c21-4b28-93ed-506e1c2b7cf4
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.972
So in the truth table we have
two sides, left side, the

3e818056-c540-4562-9516-6e6458470381
00:22:54.972 --> 00:22:58.833
binary or input variables in
the right side the outputs or

bfe102c9-243d-457c-ab1b-56b062a712a3
00:22:58.833 --> 00:23:02.343
Boolean functions. So we have
to see how many binary

NOTE Confidence: 0.8523835

f8f64ecf-7cb1-4dd3-8de0-482c4ca280e6
00:23:02.343 --> 00:23:05.853
variables we need in the left
side, how many binary

NOTE Confidence: 0.8523835

3bf4ca99-95fa-4176-8595-1f796f164fdc
00:23:05.853 --> 00:23:08.310
variables we need in the right
side.

25311252-16e7-4bbc-bdb6-7ac63a989d9d
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.098
So let's start with the
left side.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89383566

14d8d767-aaad-4a91-975c-a1454cd78ad8
00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:18.510
So for the left side, we said
that the remainder of any number

NOTE Confidence: 0.89383566

91e2947a-2fcb-400e-b02f-7b94b8e61790
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:23.690
divided by three, so we have to
ask what is the range of numbers

NOTE Confidence: 0.89383566

34b57271-76b2-41fd-a5d6-3555d6d68a50
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:28.130
we want to divide by three and
then act with the remainder.

NOTE Confidence: 0.91928834

f50e000e-56d5-436b-a8cc-fd36b393017f
00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:32.160
So the first question is this,
what is the range of numbers?

NOTE Confidence: 0.86740005

830276b1-cf4a-4cd7-ba32-4301ea7f004c
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.100
You ask the the person that put

said that I mean what is the
range of your number you want to

divide by three and ask me to
help with the remainder.

e7748c88-168b-49fd-83ad-8254909d31f3
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:49.236
So the guys would say that the
range of numbers would be

95fff012-0c09-4a95-b59d-dd2e4cee3e86
00:23:49.236 --> 00:23:50.668
between 0 and 15.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.858
So in decimal system.

c31898fb-f3b8-4ca9-8908-37316608a03f
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.336
So basically it says that I want
to give any number between 01234

NOTE Confidence: 0.8601524

421ecdfe-b976-40d4-ace4-65b1594341a9
00:23:58.336 --> 00:24:03.916
open till 15 an I want to I want
you to design A circuit that

00:24:03.916 --> 00:24:05.032
asked the remainder.

a6d3ecdf-266b-4aed-8af5-5da6c8d1e9b8
00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:11.036
But in our system we are working
with the Boolean logic or we are

d1bf48ce-3c9b-4472-9853-d2de118b7d4f
00:24:11.036 --> 00:24:14.985
working with binary system. All
our gates we know working with

35cb10e0-7f3d-4d0b-a277-53b5e2daa703
00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:17.498
zero and once so we have to.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:23.158
Transfer or transform this
decimal system to binary system.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8427432

9a989e0c-5555-4d6b-92a1-0c2edfcd13a5
00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:30.292
So in the binary system, zero
becomes zero and one becomes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8427432

c2d9272c-4ef0-4cfa-b40f-7a4f49c3d26d
00:24:30.292 --> 00:24:36.364
1/2, becomes 103, becomes 11,
etc. So basically you have to

NOTE Confidence: 0.8427432

9a465a5b-bd5a-4b12-89bd-5b81ffc46131
00:24:36.364 --> 00:24:40.228
convert all these decimal
numbers into binary.

06b21729-dc7f-4224-9acf-b92756e08f09
00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:46.320
So you know already know that
the 15 becomes 111. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.88206

a9e5cf50-f0a0-4801-8536-4eb79613d1fc
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.640
basically, for representing any
decimal number between zero to

b69fc1de-65c9-4e31-8c8b-ab40017149ce
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.040
15, we need 4 bits.

1354a687-7618-4b0e-a133-3c0e48a1ba9b
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:59.550
Fan 0. 21111 this is the
binary system, so you already

e214efd3-08cc-4d7d-960d-58fdf691a42f
00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:04.050
know how to convert a decimal

325c1bbd-2633-4416-95ff-5dbca1c13ec8
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:10.652
So for this problem you see that
the input needs four positions.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899632

afa3fd54-d798-4d4a-adb0-c9516cfde15b
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:17.300

80ecc214-4e1b-4d7f-aab8-221ae211af1a
00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.953
So now you know how many
positions you need for the

51c702e3-8bb2-4a95-98fc-caf30adf6792
00:25:23.953 --> 00:25:28.429

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.696
the remainder is 0.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.872
So you fill out the whole truth

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.870
the mid terms for each output
for F1 and F2.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:53.360
So here is the meter 8 + 210.
This is the midterm 10 and this

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:58.540
So when you write them in

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.440
what was the problem. You
just look at the entries

ddfc2a2a-691c-4fe7-8dc1-94a2483b98fc
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.890

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:08.745
So the shorter form for this
is just putting a Sigma

00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:44.230
So let's move on to the second
algorithm for design.

NOTE Confidence: 0.6671804

55846605-b39d-4856-85c6-12875052ecc0

 I'll wait a sec

b4ab0dbf-1812-44d0-87ad-de15bc5009f0
00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:52.850
So.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85456824

db5afb2f-74c4-45b2-a994-d1664e4af3b1
00:43:53.940 --> 00:44:00.115
There is another design for any
problem. If you want to design A

NOTE Confidence: 0.85456824

02b42f4f-64d1-4258-8c14-4e6a78b243c9
00:44:00.115 --> 00:44:02.015
logic circuit for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74994266

8eee2084-072c-4654-8db1-533439744409
00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:08.779
Use in the first algorithm. We
looked at those entries that

NOTE Confidence: 0.74994266

59a622cb-0c66-433e-9bac-91d2d0ef9508
00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:10.246
makes up one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.88398015

00af45ab-01ad-4f3c-8891-999c7a531275
00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:14.900
Here somebody may say that let's
look at those entries. That

NOTE Confidence: 0.88398015

3a3667c8-1fee-4c9e-82bd-51181b918e6b
00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:16.380
makes the output 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8534023

cef4bfc1-45ce-4801-ba84-67ecf688a367
00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:22.726
So if I design a second that
considers the output with zero,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8534023

b5871c80-8c42-43dd-aaa8-dad72600ecef
00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:28.355
and then I applied the nuts at
the end, it becomes our circuit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835431

3f442e65-4ab0-44b9-b380-f91a0269b7ff
00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:33.390
So basically I capture those
entries that makes the output

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835431

0ea6c150-ba06-4701-ac55-4422184dcf1f
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:38.346
zero and then apply and not
after that so it becomes a.

20ed0ecd-2aac-4102-8b8c-23d15e99ce45
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:45.335
Correct design like before, so
here is the 2nd algorithm stuff,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8318107

b4d6f67f-02e0-4bdc-b745-7294b3477360
00:44:45.335 --> 00:44:51.000
But for this one I have to
explain something called maxter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79928577

bd73c084-dd42-4514-91d8-cd81d9bb02fc
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:57.464
For previous design, we said
meters. Now we need maximum, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.79928577

79866d81-a847-4519-8309-aa1edc50a135
00:44:57.464 --> 00:45:02.238
usually maximum is all in
capital letters just to make a

NOTE Confidence: 0.79928577

6a0c2a5d-fda0-4558-a4ba-5799881668fc
00:45:02.238 --> 00:45:03.974
difference from the midterms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.76512086

b353a3a1-b179-4b98-9b42-c264ea970522
00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.660
Midterms was based on the.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8597732

de35df43-ea58-4b99-b838-52fc2b24ea02
00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.030
Based on this standard and.

32a6bfd5-b4a2-4011-87c0-6dd36150d55b
00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.348
Or by and we mean
standard product.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79515946

d76a9308-fa2a-4a1b-9fa7-58c1b6ca4dc8
00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:29.932
But here we mean maxterm and we
are dealing with some of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.7407605

444792fc-9ace-4a70-8687-718005f5a811
00:45:29.932 --> 00:45:33.526
binary variables. Let's see what
we mean by maxtone.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86682546

0fe6c438-ee5e-4472-ad78-8bceb548b852
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.480
So again, if you are given
only one binary variable,

NOTE Confidence: 0.86682546

5254fd9c-bf34-4edd-89e8-98a3c078d1bc
00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.872
the binary variable can be
in the normal form.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7982411

6a3f1706-3581-4079-a620-b911bfdba4da
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:47.630
Or in the compliment for.

NOTE Confidence: 0.93448865

4730d036-3f02-4fde-8146-1427ace49a17
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.160
So this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.791753

ed0f9f4b-9a2f-4bb4-907a-3941d1ee34bf
00:45:53.530 --> 00:45:55.450
Very similar to the midterms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82191217

24518707-2a86-48bd-bcf2-d8191e6a3d1a
00:45:56.770 --> 00:46:02.380
So now instead of assigning me
terms, I assign something called

NOTE Confidence: 0.8647263

14f8e2bc-b7e5-4aec-b745-e9ce6d6c2e54
00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:08.200
Master. And the index is the in
in a way that makes the.

NOTE Confidence: 0.794731

2d5ef991-8458-46fd-9940-56648e3270a9
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:13.106
Output for the binary variable
0. Instead of making one, it

NOTE Confidence: 0.794731

34f4f268-3960-4f94-ace8-eebafb3001aa
00:46:13.106 --> 00:46:14.294
makes it 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7782361

ef438633-55ea-4718-8801-43d2382e6367
00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:21.056
 The Max term is equal to minterm bar or minterm not. 

NOTE Confidence: 0.8881497

8a77fda8-d0d8-4601-b391-845a3ea464ef
00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:25.162
So for instance, if the
variable is happening

NOTE Confidence: 0.8881497

6d120226-d993-437a-8db5-122022f28d03
00:46:25.162 --> 00:46:26.898
in the complement form.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8068725

3db45604-19ff-4d97-add4-2ebde5d98c1c
00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.257
Which is the meters. I apply
another not on top of that. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.8068725

f2f458ab-9ad2-4565-9df3-73a9c4c3177f
00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:37.794
not on not becomes X itself so
it becomes in the normal form.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8078941

b186c51d-7aaa-459d-b048-e158ed1356c3
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:42.860
So maximum zero goes
to the normal form of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8078941

4f6c922a-085d-4add-a520-9d038a1df7ac
00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.210
the binary variables.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7974592

32f4094f-1e81-4bcb-ab77-61bb05d0a940
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:51.078
And then Max then one goes to
the emitter, one followed by

NOTE Confidence: 0.7974592

8e6fa5de-4766-41ce-969a-bd5dc8b9ff6e
00:46:51.078 --> 00:46:55.797
 not, so it was X followed by the Not becomes x bar

NOTE Confidence: 0.84014404

26e3bd4c-fb6e-4575-9efe-ae0b96295e51
00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:02.132
 So you see the difference here for the minterms we assign in 

NOTE Confidence: 0.84014404

2ae141ab-747d-4e56-9aa7-a8aca896c0e3
00:47:02.132 --> 00:47:06.488
 minterm such that makes the binary variable one. Here we 

NOTE Confidence: 0.84014404

89b6f0bc-3d5c-49b5-a2e8-1a27e6c8cb4a
00:47:06.488 --> 00:47:11.240
assign a Max term in a way
that makes the binary variable

NOTE Confidence: 0.84014404

82d0be3e-0f43-4d01-bd5c-593d998d70af
00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.200
0. So if you represent a
binary variable with the

NOTE Confidence: 0.84014404

a73f4795-6500-4a46-a894-d396ae0c359f
00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.180
binary #0, it makes the.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:24.930
Again here, if you put one in
the binary variable so one

NOTE Confidence: 0.8533202

057f222e-cc2d-4890-be75-c9ea6633f647
00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.270
followed by the not becomes 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.79928917

db727b04-ecc6-4579-b8ea-0ecf615c0307
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:33.506
So for the Max term we are
dealing with, when the binary

NOTE Confidence: 0.79928917

738f593a-557f-4962-af65-1ebea236f030
00:47:33.506 --> 00:47:38.214
variable or the term of the
binary values mix becomes 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82371086

8ec186db-bce4-46fc-836a-f0e8c10151f2
00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.690
So if you are given two
variables X&Y, these are

NOTE Confidence: 0.82371086

869fae06-0293-4966-93d7-9929989654b5
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:49.443
different weight. You can order
them together, so again,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82371086

92e11b5d-939a-4d71-b789-f814d6ec4922
00:47:49.443 --> 00:47:54.864
midterms was based on the end.
As we step, Max term is for

NOTE Confidence: 0.82371086

2bedfed9-9621-4085-9fd4-74f55f171ac4
00:47:54.864 --> 00:47:57.783
this, some or all of the binary

NOTE Confidence: 0.8167375

00:47:57.783 --> 00:48:03.810
variables. So if you're given
two binary variables, we are we,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8167375

b636ca56-6aa3-43a8-8b9b-a9b3d4e0e652
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:09.167
we may we gonna have four

normal form here X or Y.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7164395

b9161e9a-e830-4f63-bcdf-b2828c1926a3
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:22.650
Or you an order with Y or

bar or X bar?

12ca4095-6b5f-41ae-bcd0-bdd31389a755
00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:29.360
So with the two binary
variables, we're gonna have four

NOTE Confidence: 0.8504913

423e674f-c989-4ad0-9650-3755ad0be905
00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.904
different or within that.

f478c7bd-57aa-4391-aacc-4d50f418404b
00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.170
So.

7466a054-4b10-45a8-9526-fec06e02b3a4
00:48:36.810 --> 00:48:42.030
Now I want to say that the

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:48.070
or. So basically again, here is
the different orders between two

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:56.122
Now you have to assign Maxterms

NOTE Confidence: 0.7843588

48036681-634f-43cc-98b6-0f5a6ca704d4
00:56:56.122 --> 00:57:02.320
so. Maxim 0 so zero when
you are given three binary

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:13.284
Followed by not it becomes one
or one or one. So then you can

60b71591-d634-4ccd-bfdf-4809c26a0d41
00:57:13.284 --> 00:57:20.574
write it X or Y or Z. So
you assign meet Maxim 0 to this.

5e400dbc-ff6f-4041-9b02-a853fbdd283d
00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:26.310
Which is equal to midterm 0,
followed by not.

c28bd502-220c-4d29-82ea-fb9944dfe4be
00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:39.880
You assign maximum 5 to

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.772
So this is the
assignment of maxterms

NOTE Confidence: 0.8386073

ec9aaade-229a-498c-8be9-cf299dc5c2fd
00:58:04.772 --> 00:58:07.544
to three binary

the only operator is

17163f9f-e62c-43a3-97cb-70757db6ddfa
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:17.102
So in general, if you are given
N binary variables, you're gonna

e1e77f25-ee51-4950-bd3f-a4ead2a06fc3
00:58:17.102 --> 00:58:21.666
have a 2 to the power of 10
different or within them. So it

6342172f-d909-43c2-955c-10f52b1de6cc
00:58:21.666 --> 00:58:24.926
 is going to be N -- 1 and here N

00:58:29.883 --> 00:58:34.125
one have two forms. So in total
you're going to have two to the

 And here are the different forms, so.

658dd629-f60c-4b4f-844c-d0e8de9a2cc0
00:58:41.730 --> 00:58:47.814
 You see, uh, the minterm Zero goes to when they all of them 

NOTE Confidence: 0.7121228

90473eec-6e8d-4788-932b-ed0aedb8e66a
00:58:47.814 --> 00:58:50.154
happen in the normal form.

5a7d69fa-0d50-4eca-af83-9c3a9b5b61df
00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:57.672
So basically, if you create zero
in each of these variables, it

NOTE Confidence: 0.88135505

225ffb88-224e-4c4e-9a19-ea0d9bf8a369
00:58:57.672 --> 00:59:03.636
makes the maximum 0 zero or zero
or zero or zero makes it 0.

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:12.890
Maxim 1, meaning that if you
put a 0 here 00 and

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:28.585
So basically the maxterms are
making zeros based on the binary

NOTE Confidence: 0.7698888

1d3ce39b-2285-448c-85ec-659719bde69d
00:59:28.585 --> 00:59:31.060

00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:54.692

 the nots becomes 0.

And we see in the right side of
the truth table. For instance,

d4fc11b2-80b0-4d9c-ac11-779b8f769225
01:01:43.985 --> 01:01:45.365

95cdd4aa-48c8-4334-b1a4-ab654ccefe97
01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:49.892
 It means that the minterm here's the midterm 0, and here is the

f71c1bf3-19a1-495c-8a2c-94ba4da1fbd8
01:01:49.892 --> 01:01:53.540
minterm one so we can write only those midterms that makes it.

8eecf72b-12ad-4ee9-a273-1e65b4c6c6cc
01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:55.670

01:01:57.190 --> 01:02:02.635

rewrite this function.

f72e0d1b-73ea-4a9e-ba76-5324426c2fec
01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.290

e427e2c7-8270-4448-af44-6c4c91253acc
01:02:12.555 --> 01:02:17.728
0. And here's the meter one so
or them together. So basically

NOTE Confidence: 0.8610832

b7353d00-52d6-4702-adc9-cdc844c07cac
01:02:17.728 --> 01:02:22.024
this sum of some of these
products. So this is the design

b6296344-f069-49c2-aa3b-b27fb9c41194
01:02:22.024 --> 01:02:24.530
we already know how to do that.

ca27419f-da70-466f-a397-810d6a48134d
01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:31.554
So now I do am not on top
of the Boolean function.

62a82edc-362e-42d4-8b83-b85a58ccf0f0
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.574
When I do and not on top of F.

f2d7af27-505f-460b-87e7-dcd017d97e48
01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.384
We wanna see what it makes it 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8617562

0b7d1c47-905d-4700-adbf-5906ec655c20
01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:47.434
For instance, here one becomes
01, becomes 0.

56cc92c1-76ea-4c45-9fa9-9051b7500335
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:52.847
But zero becomes one and zero
becomes one. So basically just

NOTE Confidence: 0.8206864

cb2d4fac-c26d-49fc-8294-29273a8eb3ce
01:02:52.847 --> 01:02:57.971
not of the F. Whenever you see
one, it outputs zero. Whenever

1edb2f42-71f9-4e86-8e6c-682306fe98f1
01:02:57.971 --> 01:03:00.960
you see zero it out. Which one?

80497860-1090-4471-b5eb-59afc4abf25a
01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:07.806
So F1 so if or if you write in
midterms for F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8725397

dd30a6ca-8bd2-46de-9855-39a275f54b4c
01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.746
So assume that the function is
this. This is the function.

71e83a47-6a6f-4ca8-b461-15f6eece8a4b
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:20.123
This is the function
F1. Now F bar becomes

f7d2fd34-5419-4263-b1d8-906c7327e25d
01:03:20.123 --> 01:03:22.865
one in the mid term 2.

cc6351ff-a19f-46da-90d6-00a63aa5d317
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.389
And little 3.

97e2f1dd-628c-495f-9cfa-1914a0ea8b93
01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:34.669
So F becomes one for the enemy
terms zero and one F4 becomes

a59377cf-a7ea-4dbd-9d15-233b8fe2e8f3
01:03:34.669 --> 01:03:38.926
one for their remaining midterms
and two an M3.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9358136

e8c88864-aafa-468a-aaf2-917585ab3c09
01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.340
OK.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90213203

9e7c56e7-d044-4edb-b2f4-03f854013493
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:47.150
So how about now?
Can you hear me?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8930537

02a3f3a0-d52e-4f6c-83bb-e855b0a9413c
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:58.480
OK, OK so it seems
it's back so again.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7713788

ae32e4b0-3b8a-4f8d-9346-1400a31a1d37
01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:01.078
For the F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.76467794

e7c34683-fd5f-44dc-9ef1-1148bb0c4c03
01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.840
Return zero and one makes it one
for the F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.77355105

268babd6-5a3c-42d2-8d81-e0f895529c1b
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:13.105
But for the F bar, the remaining
in terms makes it a four one. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.77355105

21430848-7a12-4e51-86e2-84faa633b612
01:04:13.105 --> 01:04:14.224
M2 and M3.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9105292

5a2af8ea-f680-4a9d-9e4a-8f3432b5f9e4
01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:22.542
So whatever makes it 0, four F1
makes it 1 four F4.

NOTE Confidence: 0.77793163

fb2ed13e-b827-42e1-a2ef-808677962f60
01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:26.398
So F4 is midterm 2 and three.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9338676

feccc228-bf6c-461d-a98c-3a222bff8ddf
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.250
So.

NOTE Confidence: 0.90804434

f7b5b227-1ec1-4876-ac87-a197c0f3d292
01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.820
Now let's do this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.74946

94a7c026-2195-4156-adea-62780ce67ba8
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:44.732
All. Let's put it laser point.
OK, now I do another nuts on top

NOTE Confidence: 0.74946

d634e7e8-2295-454b-ad28-77177690b923
01:04:44.732 --> 01:04:46.668
of the F bar.

NOTE Confidence: 0.808841

10a6f809-c27d-41c2-a22a-81ec00c8c94b
01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:52.238
So F4. Followed by
the not becomes F.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7581209

1b5cd011-5afc-44a1-9985-8cd2548d2963
01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:03.824
Ask for or was already an two or
an three, followed by the nuts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7917863

3bce947a-17dc-4015-a097-fdac91d152bc
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.990
So basically I applied another
nuts to bring the FO.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8653721

d694e3cf-1a3c-461f-a8cb-77bbcbc22f88
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.040
But the right side is M2 or M3,
followed by the nuts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8850294

65fe5ef1-2974-4b79-8efe-2de3ec820fc9
01:05:19.570 --> 01:05:27.322
So we although we see the
same truth table here, 1100 the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8850294

c6b2c91d-ecc1-4bb1-9da8-455ffdaa340e
01:05:27.322 --> 01:05:29.260
same as F1100.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9124388

779f8daf-d218-4eb8-b3dc-c51c0b46907b
01:05:29.900 --> 01:05:32.665
But the right side here you see.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7390239

b4281582-6f36-4890-b3bd-1100b2088526
01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:39.200
This is for the F4M2 or M3,
followed by them nuts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84377444

d00d8f03-2d4e-4d11-bdc5-f4269cc833e0
01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:46.212
So again, F is N 0 or N1. I
create a four which becomes

NOTE Confidence: 0.84377444

d47b0c9d-5677-4594-b271-55a5232408e1
01:05:46.212 --> 01:05:51.646
M2 or M3. I applied another,
not an F for the right side

NOTE Confidence: 0.84377444

96bb8dc3-2799-4069-946d-cffd1a4181b6
01:05:51.646 --> 01:05:55.826
becomes F4 followed by the
North which becomes F but

NOTE Confidence: 0.84377444

5a00a3cf-b757-4500-9a63-089e4b16745b
01:05:55.826 --> 01:06:00.006
the right side becomes M2 or
M3 followed by dinner.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8492731

69bad1d8-478a-4b9e-b650-17d97cdc0764
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:08.886
So you see that I can rewrite F
by M2 or M3 nuts and M2 an

NOTE Confidence: 0.8492731

585e9cf5-32a3-48bc-b6e6-80d8a9f02ebc
01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:13.035
M3 or those entries that makes
the output 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8667937

d957a9d4-6867-4131-8b6b-a76426cb98e5
01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:21.382
So now I bring the not
inside the parenthesis.

NOTE Confidence: 0.788017

d5ddd0fb-b13b-46f0-97c8-f18f14bcea82
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:30.477
 So again. F is F bar followed by the nots and F4 was M2 or 

NOTE Confidence: 0.788017

0a791e1f-7a1c-43aa-8a49-b0f87ae9b8e7
01:06:30.477 --> 01:06:36.314
M3 followed by the not. I bring the not inside by D. Morgan's

01:06:36.314 --> 01:06:42.151
law. If I bring the not inside it becomes M2 bar and three

NOTE Confidence: 0.788017

4de9e7de-c21a-4968-857b-e8ce67314ee7
01:06:42.151 --> 01:06:44.396
board and or becomes an.

NOTE Confidence: 0.76340896

488658f6-c56d-4157-8806-aec454f6b559
01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:51.791
And I already know that M2
followed by the not the mid term

NOTE Confidence: 0.76340896

bc33aa8e-272f-4847-a1dd-4b5fa1bec070
01:06:51.791 --> 01:06:57.602
 2 followed by the not becomes maxterm to an M3 followed by the

ba4189f7-e8eb-4571-a11e-4c5792f6ea50
01:06:57.602 --> 01:06:59.390
not becomes maxterm

NOTE Confidence: 0.7760976

418abc3c-8825-42b9-85c8-aa3610899b0e
01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:07.030
So it becomes Maxim 2, Maxim 3
and between them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8547822

fc1f82d7-d7fa-4173-96c6-5a194c249ed0
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:12.780
An Maxim 2 is the entry that
if you write the binary

e323806c-c924-4883-96f0-35eb0ec1ec2e
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:16.290
number in the input, it
makes the output 0.

39cc66a9-1006-4432-80c6-1b4f8c70a67c
01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:20.068
And Max in three.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8782437

fba8ccc5-ba13-4e98-825b-3f4b34971a3f
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.930
If you write the input by the
binary number 43.

NOTE Confidence: 0.84365654

42bdb935-218b-422f-be5b-ff6a59004372
01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.980
The output 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8446875

fd50aafd-2d33-4fb0-9051-9d3b5b673d5c
01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:36.212
So you see that now I write F as
the end of Max term. That makes

NOTE Confidence: 0.8446875

c529b74e-bbbd-4152-99a8-34fc592ddb43
01:07:36.212 --> 01:07:37.328
the output 0.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8518163

4d3d6234-30e4-435e-be4a-7bc4671d8c20
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:46.070
And if you check, you see
that is still the app outputs

dfa7c3c7-094e-4190-b322-1b33f20544bc
01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:48.450
140001 and output 041011.

NOTE Confidence: 0.80151117

f0bc17e5-1e7f-4062-bd2b-bd4ba1d1b8fb
01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:54.826
So you can write app as the sum

NOTE Confidence: 0.70861745

53486981-174f-4df9-b96b-9ef4bae8e91c
01:07:54.826 --> 01:07:58.870
of midterm 0.
Or midterm 1.

d380a184-3897-46ba-88f9-587484bd6606
01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:05.382
Another way you can write F as
the Maxim 2 and Max down free.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89064866

e5083331-d02b-4f6a-98ef-08144e10c84d
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:08.690
So this is another design.

586bed6b-d2cf-4492-a852-6296c598c313
01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:13.666
So we can rewrite it as a
product because Ann is means

ff981b58-b885-4048-9a01-b9985b37b7c4
01:08:13.666 --> 01:08:17.542
 that ending or producting two terms. So you can minterm 2

4574eaee-3846-4b25-8b04-8e2d7c7c1449
01:08:17.542 --> 01:08:19.480
 and minterm three you can

a3ad5f98-0bc3-41e8-9dad-cd33328ada98
01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:23.128
write it. Product of
Maxim two and three.

72c48c77-d7ff-4ae9-bc6a-f848e1162ff4
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:27.930
For the meeting we have some of

239b09f9-e898-4a62-b828-9449b0bf7e76
01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:31.930
midterms. For this one we have
product of Maxterms.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7460714

49b728ba-04e8-4838-b548-069cbc130a35
01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:40.870
An Maxim 2 based on our
assignment was X or Y bar.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7907459

15b09f5f-ae07-49b9-9972-d1eb3d0bfaa4
01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:45.742
Maxim three was export or
whiteboard. How can we

NOTE Confidence: 0.7907459

43389101-daed-4c51-8252-a59a9c7a318d
01:08:45.742 --> 01:08:50.450
come up with these terms?
You can simply say that OK

NOTE Confidence: 0.7907459

fee6b689-9897-4db2-8596-14854310c48b
01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.018
Max term two is here 10.

NOTE Confidence: 0.839455

df24b0aa-d314-4e8b-ac29-65162e9f051e
01:08:55.690 --> 01:09:02.234
So 10 you have to apply a nut on
top of that becomes 01, but the

NOTE Confidence: 0.839455

6c1f5525-b122-4d6a-ab19-6877885743e0
01:09:02.234 --> 01:09:06.324
OR between them? So let me
change to the pan.

16299f7f-9a68-4e15-8dfe-efe3d9be6867
01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:13.965
So Maxim 2 Maxim 2 is here 10.
You apply not it becomes one or

NOTE Confidence: 0.82326525

75e5a447-8073-4ad0-9f33-ceb75e1ad308
01:09:13.965 --> 01:09:19.377
zero. And now you can write it.
So this is the X.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8038483

8e5bcba0-a72e-4b9d-b87a-385609f54e49
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:23.206
And this is the Y bar and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.86505765

3e1571ca-f913-4787-b8b8-5e85c9326e10
01:09:23.206 --> 01:09:25.704
or between them. This is the

d3a23130-b7ea-4ce7-b781-0240c3108106
01:09:25.704 --> 01:09:28.855
next time too. And this is
the Max term fee.

NOTE Confidence: 0.87468094

0e319a5b-56ea-4544-ba78-dbf46976cbb2
01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:35.105
So you see that if you write the
F only by looking at the zeros,

NOTE Confidence: 0.87468094

29fdb0ad-a42b-42de-917c-6755f3ab6ec8
01:09:35.105 --> 01:09:38.810
you have to write it by the Max
terms and product of that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.81026053

68d262fd-0412-4204-b13e-2894f7208dad
01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:40.479
And between that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8994912

ea78c13a-2268-40c3-838e-eb109f390369
01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:45.430
And here is the design.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7280723

5972c314-5046-4305-9e27-98cc061c034f
01:09:46.050 --> 01:09:51.366
So for the match term you apply
orpin binding variables 1st and

NOTE Confidence: 0.7280723

c44c8de5-3860-4224-b3b4-299fd85ba1f0
01:09:51.366 --> 01:09:53.138
then add them together.

b8bb0cdc-aaf6-411d-9114-f1078af67c98
01:09:54.130 --> 01:09:56.030
So this is the master.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83473116

c5f98d32-6f76-46d7-bcbd-953397fdcffa
01:09:56.620 --> 01:09:58.128
What's the maximum here?

NOTE Confidence: 0.9028638

6e95ee23-cffc-4c5a-bcfd-e98a261846ac
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:04.914
2. Because here if you
have zero or one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.85579294

3793697f-99a7-459a-91e1-e804b5c25fa0
01:10:05.490 --> 01:10:10.992
01 If you apply another nut, it
brings it to mid term, so it

175195e5-b441-42b2-806b-77e5c8340c28
01:10:10.992 --> 01:10:12.957
becomes 10 and between them.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:18.702
So this is the new term 2, so
meter two followed by the not

2f7d7629-2e5e-4c03-8288-db9838597a69
01:10:18.702 --> 01:10:23.200
becomes maximum 2. And this is
the Maxterm 3.

1842c54a-87ae-494a-b068-04ffcffe92c6
01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.188
Order the result gonna be under.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.450

01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:55.157
That's why we called the second
design product of sums. So

23408a67-c5be-4b77-9b75-89728ba5af95
01:10:55.157 --> 01:10:59.668
basically you have to write the
Max terms in terms of this sum

b5e7fb60-d586-461e-b546-23d8fcbc61d7
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.200
 The first design is SOP the second design is POS

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.450
Here is the another example.
Imagine we have this truth

01:11:41.886 --> 01:11:46.022
the meter, so the midterm 01
and three is the function.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8129742

5220d93a-d27e-4667-af6f-7dcb31919c5e
01:11:46.022 --> 01:11:49.406
Now we want to write it as
the maxterms.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.725
For the Max term, as I said, you
apply an not.

a59cf5af-a1c2-4b92-a774-b68a310de1c7
01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:07.026

makes this one one.

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:10.750
 And then apply another not.

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:17.438
To bring it back to F so F4
followed by bar becomes F, but

ac01af1a-58ae-41c1-bb70-bb0c13548e12
01:12:31.484 --> 01:12:37.907

Just an OR gate is enough, but
because we say that we have two

5ad5cbbb-f391-485d-9105-8a77a292fcda
01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:54.816

c26c1083-a7c8-4f54-bf0f-5fb3e68c4615
01:14:54.816 --> 01:15:00.052
then write it as in your design.

01:15:00.052 --> 01:15:05.040

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:09.462
correct or effective, the first
design needs 4 gates. The second

c4cc0f7f-3df1-4e19-adf8-0cd23d39d4a7
01:15:09.462 --> 01:15:11.874
design is only one gate, so.

0205ff37-df34-4bb8-9627-92de7a0eaab2
01:15:12.570 --> 01:15:16.739

11b5b4ef-7708-401d-9e74-0c68f747afed
01:15:16.739 --> 01:15:19.771
more cheaper, so the second
design is better.

9424c23c-8635-41c2-b484-df81850bec0b
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:22.120

01:15:29.086 --> 01:15:33.094
true gates. So in the second
design you have two gates, but

db8b3a32-d196-4dd9-801e-5ffaaaa90a1f
01:15:33.094 --> 01:15:37.436
in the first design you need 4
gates. So whenever you want to

01:15:37.436 --> 01:15:41.110

you have to keep that. Although

01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:44.784
 both are correct but which one needs less number of gates

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:49.771

01:15:49.771 --> 01:15:51.626
 because in the SOP

3238a116-6805-43b3-9898-e8f57aac4e2b
01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:54.690

order together.

f2e2bf5b-ec84-4895-bc67-239ef9ab1661
01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:06.608

eb89da1c-4bb6-425d-938f-0e9b1c09cf04
01:16:18.910 --> 01:16:22.496
