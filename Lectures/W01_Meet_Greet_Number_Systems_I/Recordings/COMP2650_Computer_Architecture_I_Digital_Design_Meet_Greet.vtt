d36bfba0-efb4-464a-801b-fb1ec8ee3285
00:27:15.417 --> 00:27:17.818
going to write a program to just

eaf06fdf-192f-4968-ae67-6443dc7c5636
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:26.990
reduced to a function. So
function has a return type,

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.930
so this is the return of an
addition and we pick a name

NOTE Confidence: 0.85858595

c39ffbe1-ab41-4ba2-b9c6-d7fc6edf14dc
00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:35.730
for the function for. For
adding two numbers we need

998ab117-0edd-4637-b087-5c91ace0ba40
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:48.220
And then we create a result of
the I mean Function A+B. So in

78dd059a-dbb2-4f35-9e6f-25ec789ec35d
00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:52.970
order to solve the addition
problem, we just use the

a4e776a3-1fa7-4889-b424-4ac124bd8fe8
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.345
operator. Plus in C language.

a4b48a11-50d4-439b-876f-5832293ffc2a
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:59.720
And then return a result.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8571501

ebde2eaf-2bf6-466a-a900-35f4ffd653a6
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:09.686
But this is the most simplest
program, so actually we haven't

NOTE Confidence: 0.8571501

8923fa23-bcda-4520-a012-9bed67d418f4
00:28:09.686 --> 00:28:14.702
solved the problem of summation.
We just use these some operator

NOTE Confidence: 0.8571501

1a3be1fb-35a5-4ff5-a5f8-cb250b91eb0b
00:28:14.702 --> 00:28:20.630
in the C language. So let's just
test this function or to see

7de63219-527e-410f-b2a7-0c3299d0981f
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:26.558
that it is possible to solve the
addition. So let's ask the user.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.718

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:41.450
And then if the user Inputs 2
numbers, we have to receive.

have to receive those two

ad242544-81c0-46b9-9ae8-0bae2e99c1a2
00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:51.182
numbers, so numbers are on the
symbol, so you know when we

c28ec637-558c-439b-9bbe-4f1818c5cc90
00:28:51.182 --> 00:28:55.874
receive the input from the
user. You have to store it in

00:28:55.874 --> 00:28:59.784
a variable as you know. So
let's create two variable

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:08.477
Also, we have to sort the
results somewhere. We could call

d934323b-28a3-4d75-9749-2f5bbeaf5f9a
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.060
So the first number the
user enters you can store

91c00798-b815-48df-ae90-49d8b51187ea
00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:18.790

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:24.150
So then we ask the user
to enter another number.

1ca4e4eb-8d06-4964-ba2a-3e25c8903486
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:31.720

So we call the add number

And then at the end we have to.

f6c38459-5609-4640-b75f-cc0381bbe418
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.040

function. So it determines how
to interpret the numbers or the

send, we hear you say that the

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:06.750
So we say that we do, adding
each digit but each other

bffcaab1-7bc8-47b2-8643-826482166df1

this sort of that side, so 8

11 here, but we can. Now we

00:41:20.225 --> 00:41:24.845
have to put just one #1
digit. So when then we divide

bf22969e-ec3c-4aad-9c0b-b360985e8cd1
00:41:24.845 --> 00:41:26.770

a87834a2-8c58-4776-bfc0-bea3f2ae5abf
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.777
So we put the remainder in the

result. And this is the Carrie.
So we put this carry to the

d79668fc-ef26-49b7-9159-c6b1d7eb8716
00:41:39.412 --> 00:41:44.434

we would have.

and 9 + 0 is not so this is
the basic algorithm which is

now the second number.

01:01:52.136 --> 01:01:56.595
the program and the last digit
is 8, because 9 + 9 becomes

a9d14534-33bb-4798-abbc-089970065e59
01:01:56.595 --> 01:02:01.397
eight goes to carry 9 + 9 eight

1a5dccbd-7aa5-4d79-bdc7-e83e463480a7
01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:06.885
So the 1st digit is 1, which if
you scroll up we can see the 1st

01:03:12.075 --> 01:03:18.646
reason is. As you can see, what

01:03:18.646 --> 01:03:20.556
and then second step another

01:03:20.556 --> 01:03:27.156

we increase the eye to the end

01:03:27.156 --> 01:03:33.186
of the area so we do all this
summation. So when we are at the

191ba8c2-79c4-4f02-88d4-7993b19bd1a4
01:03:33.186 --> 01:03:37.206

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:42.464
We are when we are in this

minus one. So N steps we are

38dd9cdc-66f0-4800-807f-0c03ed0f575b
01:03:46.902 --> 01:03:48.170

cb756037-6e3e-4f84-93cd-1b54005aa142
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:53.418
So also we have another carry
here, so we do another, for

ba07d075-c9a8-4383-992d-9a995475fa85
01:03:53.418 --> 01:03:59.103
instance son so becomes N minus
1 + 1. So in general we end with

bd1f0c0d-c7ac-47d5-9c00-cad69dcd68ac

So that's the correct answer.
But again, even for the big

But then we add the project to
add to big numbers.

c26d97e9-220f-49cc-b69f-8fcef5ac2152
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.820
And you see that this program is
working properly even for the

69623dea-0fc8-4c48-ae46-67a7bb0074a8
01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:28.828
And the timing is very fast as
we see the number of steps is

980d4265-8c42-4d2d-9352-eafca1d5343d
01:05:28.828 --> 01:05:30.463

01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.410
OK.

496f3ab7-1f4f-49f5-be01-ad5b2baa066e
01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.780
And then now I just wanted
to show you that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.83587015

43f0acd9-6934-40e5-aeb2-a24b226203d8
01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:52.930
If I reiterate this edition,
this I mean 250K digits.

NOTE Confidence: 0.935134

20e42404-e9af-4ab0-ad50-d5c640874d33
01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.858
For one time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9252323

8e550ecf-307e-4bdb-a3f0-35390fa409f8
01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.275
It's very fast, but if I run
this for 100 times.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

0c1679ea-0b27-4df5-898e-82acbe67e09d
01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:05.250
And the application is for
instance for matrix addition for

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

40b5b61f-2204-4a17-ae9c-115c36d3ed31
01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:10.658
matrix. If you have two matrix,
each one has a dimension 10 by

14d5f46d-b534-4be4-aaae-a7cd34007e13
01:06:10.658 --> 01:06:16.066
10 and if you wanted to do the
addition, it becomes 100 times

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

1eb126f7-e1ba-46b2-ab1c-bfcbe2b7867b
01:06:16.066 --> 01:06:20.642
edition. So if you wanted to
addition of two matrix with

a43c5ec8-55a7-4630-9c60-9b29e20e5d8a
01:06:20.642 --> 01:06:25.634
hundred elements, so we have to
do this summation instead of 1

NOTE Confidence: 0.8609369

3e08cfdd-4346-4761-9da3-59a76759c61d
01:06:25.634 --> 01:06:30.210
time 100 times. So if we
increase the iteration, this is

873e596a-8674-46e1-94b0-6b234ce18c8b
01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:31.874
the program I did.

49ed6e68-7f63-4372-9912-58ae608e0524
01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.836
To show you that if the number
of addition for this program

555a9c4b-7d56-4980-92a4-375a5e6358fb
01:06:37.836 --> 01:06:43.560
increases. From one 2 two 1000,
the running time increases two

e9776004-06f2-4763-b0e8-6ff89a7fda03
01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.260
linearly, so if you do the
additional 50K numbers 400,000

NOTE Confidence: 0.87845737

c1ab8510-d6b2-4d9c-93fe-c8c17a00f2fc
01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:53.900
for 1000 times, it becomes 2
seconds and as I said, the

34e6993c-5438-4aba-b5ca-ff6831c13387
01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.310
applications for matrix

a8fbc9f4-c106-4caf-9fba-d9afc0a9e3e9
01:06:55.310 --> 01:07:00.695
summation. So again, we need
to know how to make it fast

NOTE Confidence: 0.90867835

8fe1c46c-a1ed-46e0-aff0-807ee6f70300
01:07:00.695 --> 01:07:04.645
and the knowledge we need is
the knowledge from computer

f1930400-9a66-453e-8842-51b7114f2c63
01:07:04.645 --> 01:07:08.595
system. If we know how the
computer system is working

01:07:08.595 --> 01:07:12.940
inside, we can come up with
the program that runs faster

b9b2b1ad-7b7c-4671-8ef2-f1c6e0fcf63d
01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.520
and lowers down this.

f8960d96-083a-4a46-831b-bcb5ed1eaaa2
01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:21.036
Linear I mean increase of the
time to just a little bit slow.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8490203

cd849112-48aa-4c01-b281-209fac83f538
01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:25.740
I mean the sleep becomes a
little bit lower and the program

4a83f7f5-cb2a-402a-829c-9e4126862f03
01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.916
actually runs faster.

01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:34.446

machine, so you have to know
basics of the machine it's

fa3088a0-6ac1-4c30-a393-bdb1c38584e2
01:11:58.024 --> 01:12:02.237
What's the knowledge or ability
of these students? So here I

01:12:02.237 --> 01:12:06.450

01:12:15.114 --> 01:12:19.866
of that. So a successful student
actually, after passing this

7df1fc76-cfd2-4b0f-bca8-fe1b291d4b02
01:12:19.866 --> 01:12:23.619

01:12:23.619 --> 01:12:28.623
Most importantly the CPU and
also to design a new circuit. So

NOTE Confidence: 0.86179715

83512719-1efa-4f8c-bc82-06930a6b10d8
01:12:28.623 --> 01:12:34.044
if we give you some problem, you
are able to design in digital

NOTE Confidence: 0.86179715

03e91283-779a-4bd9-9db7-c6afbf2ef040
01:12:34.044 --> 01:12:38.214
circuits and also you can
explain how a computer system

05035555-ecbd-42d5-80dc-eeb685eeefed
01:12:38.214 --> 01:12:43.218
works. But one thing is that
here in this course we don't

a9668c8a-2855-481d-9522-6928efdecf57

7a7435e6-dd68-474c-aa8a-f89a83582bc3
01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:54.254
So I'm in terms of physical
sense. You can design the CPU in

01:12:54.254 --> 01:12:59.406
a pain and with a pen in a

01:12:59.406 --> 01:13:03.822
As I said, you can take advanced

01:13:41.064 --> 01:13:45.345
four pages. Uh, the version
right now in the blackboard is

80285d13-8ba9-45fd-9fbf-9d4d1cf0bf76
01:13:45.345 --> 01:13:48.495

01:13:48.495 --> 01:13:52.275

is a little bit change to the
document, so the next version

031ebc3d-da8f-4c48-8886-009c316ff319
01:13:59.835 --> 01:14:04.245
going to be for instance 1.1. If
it is a minor change. If there's

1b8814ac-abcb-44eb-b7ae-9520e8a41cc9
01:14:04.245 --> 01:14:07.395
a huge change, it becomes
version two or version 3.
