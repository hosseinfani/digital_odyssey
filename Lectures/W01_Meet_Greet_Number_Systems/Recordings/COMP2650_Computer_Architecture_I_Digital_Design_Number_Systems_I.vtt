cdbca8f1-c2d0-4c4b-b4fa-8e9fdb51a3ed
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.670
They started to form some
problems. One of the basic ones

6a164e73-4a49-4c27-9e6a-e17cb5193f12
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.610
are those that they just wanted
to travel to the stars or just.

14bed782-89b2-4771-b23d-a182160a964e

They just wanted to explore the

universe. So the first step to
do that is just.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.395
How can we measure the distance
of our own earth to the stars?

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:35.015
Or how can we measure the
height? Or how can we measure

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:39.250
the lengths so these are just
very basic problems, but it's

still essential problems?

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.590

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.920
And we want to measure the
distance, for instance from

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.235
are just very basic questions
pop up to the mind of the people

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.126
So how can we do that? How
can we measure for instance,

a6b054fa-e70e-48e5-915f-62ed4eb6da71
00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:14.306
and this is like the moon's
distance to the sun.

dfaf5e88-c729-4678-a0eb-76ec0e6717bc

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.186
version of the solution to the
problem was that let's take

0f5d6208-afa2-47aa-9216-f53b3d4f28fc
00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:50.146
another object or another store

db8727ff-f8c9-469f-b66d-3ed69d46dc2c

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.336

 moon to the sun, we can take the Earth as the unit and

56294e55-15dd-4333-839b-cd4ad3e27e2c
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.748
then we can.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.470

based on the number of Earth you
have to take to reach the sun

bfac24e3-6151-4adc-bef6-c72070fabea4

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.152
So this was the most naive

7931f430-f389-4df6-a292-8c4fa79a30c8
00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:27.170
version. So the problem actually
reduced to this. How many Earth

we need to pass.

a9577694-2b32-4452-bff2-4457eb6fcffe
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.066
So at first we put just one
errors and then secondary. So

f1b3d849-75dc-4698-a78c-209d4f6cc3f3
00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:38.602
it means that we have to pass
twice the earth diameter and

ec4696d0-123f-4c39-a6dc-5492d0abe394
00:04:38.602 --> 00:04:43.894
 then 3, four and five. So the five is actually is kind of, I

But we can have a compromise

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.344
and we can say that the most

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:52.878
 continue counting. So then the next number is 3 1, which is

dd58515f-ed2f-48bd-a6d2-915cdeb180ec

So now the next step is for, but

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:12.145
we don't have the digit 44. So
again as we did for here in this

ffd8da4e-6867-41b9-a869-3011a45666a2
00:42:12.145 --> 00:42:16.916

then we add 0. So in my

00:42:42.152 --> 00:42:46.694

here for the four, instead of

00:42:49.798 --> 00:42:55.230
right. So we keep three in the
right and then add 0, so 03

5e3d6c95-cdcb-48b3-857f-e30e3e4b8608

00:43:34.418 --> 00:43:40.466
So for instance, the next after
8 is 9, so 331 is equal to 9 and

e0f92d3d-c34c-4487-8035-0df9115fd3fe
00:43:40.466 --> 00:43:41.978
then 332 is 10.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:29.347
a valid number in system.
Why the reason is?

b238d9de-5541-40c9-a66d-434bdddec97c
00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:35.123
In my system, the way I can't
the units you have to introduce

4b48da5b-e167-4487-8b14-5786aeee1365
00:46:35.123 --> 00:46:40.597
a new position when we are drawn
out of the digits, so you don't

a6318a33-4207-4f0e-b4d9-c922fa85de16
00:46:40.597 --> 00:46:46.462
have zero in between. So here as
you can see we are done with the

1c0ff749-e625-4b1f-b966-82c9520ad9b6
00:46:46.462 --> 00:46:51.154
three and then we introduce new
position. But we are not putting

00:46:51.154 --> 00:46:55.455
123. So in Hossein's numbering system, all the positions in the

left side must occupied with the

e5cdcef2-23a2-4058-9084-6cbfdd5ea46f

the answer.
So the

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:58.300

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:03.780
123. We keep that here and then
we introduce a new position and

dc6ef132-b86d-48d3-867b-dc77450df2f3
00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:07.795
then we did another three and
then we introduce a new

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.365
whenever we introduce a new

00:50:51.209 --> 00:50:57.956

00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.406
So from

e71e77d3-5da8-4382-8a4d-ab188da38f84
00:51:05.406 --> 00:51:11.262
0123. This is the
exact equal number in the

e3c19dcf-793e-4c5b-955e-e15896a199ad
00:51:11.262 --> 00:51:16.230
decimal system, so we don't have
any new position, so it means

NOTE Confidence: 0.87939190864563

785b685d-02b5-49fc-9a33-513464ba24e4
00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:21.612
that for the we don't have new
positions, so there is no unit

a7d6da99-0ca8-42b5-a3e8-5077459cc548
00:51:21.612 --> 00:51:28.236
taken by the new position. So 1

00:51:30.306 --> 00:51:35.660
number. And then when we are
here, we introduce a new

abd233b3-3aaf-4904-8888-dfe5144b01cf
00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:40.532

we already take three steps.

But we introduced new positions.

9fb99d38-ada9-4652-80d1-85fb4bdf37bf
00:51:46.404 --> 00:51:51.708

four altogether, some together.

And then we continue here, for
instance, here we have three

aa00c9a9-0fa1-4cd2-b67e-ab2c275df955
00:51:57.067 --> 00:52:01.434
step before three step another
step, and then we introduce a

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.888
So let's continue so.

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

91805cef-a58f-47fe-b613-5caa40125de9
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:19.580
Now imagine in general we have N
positions. What is the minimum

1129015d-3d9a-439c-9acb-ff6800b148a1
00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:24.255
number in Hossein System and
what is the maximum number? So

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

6463f725-2643-4244-abb9-a035d1989294
00:54:24.255 --> 00:54:29.780
the minimum number is the 0 so
we can just Simply put the

ae20a4b0-8b8f-4a03-abe7-7770c9944729
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:34.880
digits zero in all positions. So
the minimum is trivial 0. How

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

86284a15-f7f3-4468-a054-b3ba14e9a451
00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:39.130
about the maximum the maximum
number in hosting system is

NOTE Confidence: 0.86091947555542

8435248b-9782-45a4-a60e-e2a377a1f65c
00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:44.230
equal to this number in all
positions we put the digit 3.

NOTE Confidence: 0.905778050422668

91836136-4a1e-4bf3-a2f1-56381543cc69
00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:48.930
So 3333 up until the

1df9a98a-5e8e-4810-9779-4982cfb3e871
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:54.320
first position. So let's count all these three and see what is

NOTE Confidence: 0.838525950908661

8804faeb-1ed3-4e77-8934-d94d3e9c8ac3
00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:55.720
the equal Max number?

da977842-e06c-49a5-aa85-9561fa265b26
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:04.935
By simply math, I mean we can
just do this. I mean I get all

f08dae42-81ea-4b88-81e4-4d69d6ed1125
00:55:04.935 --> 00:55:08.862
these steps we've done so far,
plus the number of new

00:55:08.862 --> 00:55:13.146
positions. So we have an
position N minus one is than you

c9f95952-773a-4d99-ab65-29e177322217
00:55:13.146 --> 00:55:14.931
so plus N minus one.

ecae4a8c-9e54-4778-9fb7-20da278026ae
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.798
So it becomes.

85cd7279-d5eb-42ee-8e5f-c520afb3b879
00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:24.445
3 N plus N minus one at the
end we have four times N minus

00:55:24.445 --> 00:55:31.012
one. So as an example, if we
are given 10 position as we did

NOTE Confidence: 0.877792298793793

01bb6cc4-4c88-44a0-8551-22678a55ac7e
00:55:31.012 --> 00:55:36.528
calculation, it is equal to four
times and which is equal to 10 -

00:55:36.528 --> 00:55:40.074
1. So 40 - 1 is 39. So in

00:55:44.846 --> 00:55:49.526
represent numbers from 012 up
until 39, but you cannot

00:55:49.526 --> 00:55:54.674
 represent 40 in Hossein's system when you are given only 10

55db7fed-18b1-4dad-98fe-3c7aa9a5ce49
00:55:54.674 --> 00:55:58.330

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:12.347
So as you can see in

e071ce91-c7ea-4e5c-9760-b76051fc4f12
00:56:21.178 --> 00:56:25.186
wanted to know how many space

00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:30.406

58260053-a5c7-455b-ab64-f231c8c291b7
00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:35.592
The answers that you just simply
take that given number as the

13db0963-8dde-4a7e-94c9-7ca798240c6c
00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:39.864
maximum number and then put it
in that formula. So imagine the

f8e28f66-1c81-40f6-9980-30d955784347
00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:44.136
maximum number we are going to

2d1e95d3-6c9e-4f01-97e5-e78a00f00a0a
00:56:44.136 --> 00:56:48.764
capital N is the maximum is
equal to four times N minus one.

120e0adb-5ffe-4af1-be79-8e78e09ee0aa
00:56:51.256 --> 00:56:56.518
positions. So by doing a little

00:57:11.532 --> 00:57:15.943
 this time in Hossein System, not in the unary system. And see whether

b5016207-4e41-4bc7-b63a-dce3c5058325
00:57:15.943 --> 00:57:19.953
 the Hossein System is a better system or not.

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:43.510
So again, imagine you are given
the distance. The actual

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:07.946
about 12,000 Earth or units of Earth. So in unary system we

00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:14.433
 So this time Wanna represent this number in Hossein's system? So

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:46.260

53571bf9-98d3-4264-b521-ec32fcefdf59

01:03:27.785 --> 01:03:31.877

6ee4f593-2fc6-48bb-b397-934a2014e40d
01:03:40.864 --> 01:03:47.452

And when we are going to the

20a594ba-5fb5-478a-9bf2-8d51028d4601
01:03:47.452 --> 01:03:50.386

f91cbd5f-d1c0-40aa-97a7-6fb65e53d546
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.164
But this time, instead of just
keeping the three, we keep the

b5d0f7e6-00b5-47ca-8016-2de3e005a81f

01:04:03.134 --> 01:04:08.780

6ad6fedd-9bea-4ad1-b60b-16cb736ec059

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:15.591
I mean rounds over the four

a5c0d811-e097-47c8-a20b-8d9b426aa07a

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.720
So we interpret this one
in the new position as,

NOTE Confidence: 0.861205160617828

4c5fa29a-6268-444c-90d4-9dcffc23a512
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.944
which having as a signal
more significant number.

67cb0830-37b6-4b99-a5be-5d9cbd4c2251
01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:35.220
We continue now to the next
count, so the one is 1 round, so

NOTE Confidence: 0.851468503475189

cd50ce57-e442-4c24-b359-09758515d383
01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:39.895
again 101112 and then in this
position we did another round.

NOTE Confidence: 0.851468503475189

a709b9ea-d104-45ff-ba4d-d321e9f70e69
01:04:39.895 --> 01:04:45.420
So we just increment 1 three and
then you just increment the one

NOTE Confidence: 0.851468503475189

26dbae65-ea96-4b0a-bb17-a28149aafe57
01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:50.520
to two. So we did two rounds
instead of just keeping the

28556b7f-ea83-4b4a-82dc-6ba0ceb91a49
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.770

the one to two.

fb3f69d1-2a14-4f44-a769-72fb7fc55fce
01:04:56.070 --> 01:05:01.670
So, but these two is more
significant than the two

2cc1cb02-3611-4334-a880-2af4891ea12f
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:03.910
in the first position.

cfd313ba-439e-4cca-9e08-f7b6d309e88d
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:09.710
So this way instead of just
keeping the fee, we keep track

2e310563-5b8f-47a6-8c28-f6de42c3541b
01:05:09.710 --> 01:05:12.870
of the rounds of we we did over

15f01b56-5f39-4329-8cb6-bfcc5028ecf6
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:17.569
the digits. And then we can
continue this way.

00de9752-a767-4b13-9a6c-b4c0d4d8bd6b
01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:23.786
So my question is this, when we
end up with the three 3 means

b8a54736-bc8a-4793-a4da-7c53bdad3fef
01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:28.648
that we did three rounds over
all the digits plus 3 units and

NOTE Confidence: 0.877388179302216

e12a2ee9-ef1c-42ca-bee8-3d9df89015c2
01:05:28.648 --> 01:05:33.884
the next step is also in this
step with it 4 rounds, so we

1ad23a69-a4d0-49f5-b965-f844c6403269
01:05:33.884 --> 01:05:38.372
have to represent four rounds,
but we don't have the digit 44.

NOTE Confidence: 0.881112098693848

37dcdc1a-83b6-4a7f-a303-48d0874cd9fa
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:46.170
So the solution is again we do
the same as we did in the first

NOTE Confidence: 0.881112098693848

83ff33d1-6bac-4173-b0b4-0a8c8d441fc5
01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:50.530
position. So imagine we don't
have the first unit first

0c0b740e-95c9-4ec7-b3b0-68832bd1c5bb
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:56.198
position, so we did one round
over the digit, but this time in

6ca18879-d823-4731-975f-3c659c223acc
01:05:56.198 --> 01:06:00.558
the second position. So we
introduce a new position one,

62abd5f4-5e2a-4c36-a980-b1d82c4af053
01:06:00.558 --> 01:06:05.354
and then in put a zero in the
all other positions.

round overall digits, but in the

But when we go to the when we

number is a valid number

NOTE Confidence: 0.89786684513092

9eae8248-b9a7-490c-b5f9-ced4bf4c793c
01:12:59.177 --> 01:13:02.161
and then convert it to the
decimal number.

a6694277-6399-43a4-a7e0-effbf173eabe
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:28.010
So let's share my blackboard.

ab030c6a-f20e-4d2b-ab81-d3c0094221b8
01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:33.910
And see.
What's

79e3f161-e91f-456c-bed3-cfc1934ca0bc
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.200
the

cf23f66b-b036-4327-a873-c5c5beab0583
01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:43.800
solution? So
the number here is 3333.

NOTE Confidence: 0.875674903392792

2610bf6d-626a-47f5-80b3-7ddd2557c39c
01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:47.220
How many feet? We have 5 feet.

b2b426ac-dba3-4bb3-b4b3-708a7ff43512
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.890
And two. So the first
step is we have to find the

NOTE Confidence: 0.884553670883179

4b2033bf-be87-4988-8f11-0939ae73c105
01:13:54.890 --> 01:14:00.082
significance of the position. So
it's not because this number is

bddcb1f5-9a31-4da5-affe-181e34678d33
01:14:00.082 --> 01:14:05.274
in the base 4, something system,
so the significance of the

f683e27e-2bde-49cc-9594-b9767cfe2ee6
01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:10.938
position is based on the powers
of four. So this significance is

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:33.428
And then. 4 to the power of 5
so first you have to determine

3b266143-e63a-4131-b708-7745505ce623
01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:36.884
the significance of the
positions because the number is

01:14:36.884 --> 01:14:41.492
in the base 4 system, so the
significance is based on the

44c28297-ac83-4aed-a59a-dbfa9327fd28
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:50.960
Then you have to multiply each

99dbd7c0-e7b7-480a-96be-c4f9212a9194
01:17:19.648 --> 01:17:24.112
mean comparing to the base 4.
First of all, in the first

ffb4fa5c-c47f-4340-abaa-47d6d11ee178
01:17:24.112 --> 01:17:28.630
number. This number is not a
valid number in Hossein system,

6eed4af0-971e-4d7f-8083-95a2185daa36
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:33.805
but it is a valid number in base
four. It means that the base for

f75ef9ad-b1fb-4bdd-a919-fde899aef291
01:17:54.250 --> 01:17:58.786

01:17:58.786 --> 01:18:04.078
 Hossein's system is just about 39. So you can see that the base for

is evidently that better number

01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:47.110

It's a little bit different
concept because here as you see

far was not compression, but the

system. For instance, based on
five digits, 3 digits, any

number of digits, and you
introduce your own digits.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:33.140
And then you have to tell how
can you interpret or how can you

count the units so you can
introduce position to the right

01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:41.940
and then you have your own
symbols. For instance, you could

have six symbols and your
symbols is not necessary to be

01. You can have your own
symbols, but the interpretation

01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:54.340
interpretation is important. You
could say that my symbol is

01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:59.140
equal to 0 in decimal system.
This symbol is equal to 1.

01:25:59.210 --> 01:26:03.621
And then I will introduce
position to the right and then

this is the formulation. In
order to map my number system

So there is no limit to that.
